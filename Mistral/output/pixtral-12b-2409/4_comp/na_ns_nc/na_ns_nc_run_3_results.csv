### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Row:**
   - Shapes: Hexagon, Square, Hexagon
   - Pattern: Alternating between hexagons and squares.

2. **Second Row:**
   - Shapes: Hexagon, Triangle, Square
   - Pattern: Alternating between hexagons, triangles, and squares.

3. **Third Row:**
   - Shapes: Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon
   - Pattern: All hexagons.

4. **First Column:**
   - Shapes: Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon
   - Pattern: All hexagons.

5. **Second Column:**

1. **Shape Analysis**:
   - The shapes in the grid include triangles, pentagons, and circles.
   - Each shape contains different symbols (triangles, circles, and pentagons) inside them.

2. **Positional Analysis**:
   - The shapes are arranged in a specific order in the grid, and the empty box is in the bottom row, third column.

3. **Pattern Identification**:
   - The shapes in the top row are a triangle, a pentagon, and a circle.
   - The shapes in the middle row are a triangle, a pentagon, and a circle.
   - The shapes in the bottom row are a triangle, a pentagon, and the empty box.

4. **Symbol Analysis**:
   - Each shape contains a combination of symbols (triangles, circles, and pentagons).
   - The symbols are arranged differently in each shape.

Given these observations, let's identify the correct pattern:

- The top row has a triangle with symbols (triangle, circle, pentagon), a pentagon with symbols (circle, pentagon, circle), and a circle with symbols (triangle, circle, pentagon).
- The middle row has a triangle with symbols (triangle, circle, pentagon), a pentagon with symbols (circle, pentagon, circle), and a circle with symbols (triangle, circle, pentagon).
- The bottom row has a triangle with symbols (triangle, circle, pentagon), a pentagon with symbols (circle, pentagon, circle), and the empty box.

To complete the pattern, the empty box should contain the same arrangement of symbols as the other shapes in the bottom row. The correct answer should be a triangle with the symbols (triangle, circle, pentagon).

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a pentagon, and a circle.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a square, a pentagon, and an inverted triangle.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a pentagon, and a square.

Now, let's look at the options provided (A to F):

- **A**: Square
- **B**: Inverted triangle
- **C**: Pentagon
- **D**: Hexagon
- **E**: Circle
- **F**: Pentagon

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern that relates the shapes in the grid. One possible pattern could be the alternation of shapes based on their geometric properties (e.g., number of sides, orientation).

Let's analyze the pattern:

- The top row has a hexagon, a pentagon, and a circle.
- The middle row has a square, a pentagon, and an inverted triangle.
- The bottom row has a hexagon, a pentagon, and a square.

Given this, the pattern might be based on the number of sides or the type of shape. The empty box is in the bottom row, which currently has a hexagon, a pentagon, and a square. The missing shape in the bottom row should follow the pattern of the other shapes.

Since the bottom row has a hexagon and a square, the missing shape should be a pentagon to maintain the pattern.

1. Top row: Triangle with a small triangle inside, small triangle inside, and large triangle inside.
2. Middle row: Pentagon with a small hexagon inside, small hexagon inside, and large hexagon inside.
3. Bottom row: Triangle with a small circle inside, small circle inside, and an 'X' mark.

To determine the pattern, let's look at the shapes and their transformations:

- The first column has a triangle with a small triangle inside, a pentagon with a small hexagon inside, and a triangle with a small circle inside.
- The second column has a triangle with a small triangle inside, a pentagon with a small hexagon inside, and a triangle with a small circle inside.
- The third column has a triangle with a large triangle inside, a pentagon with a large hexagon inside, and an 'X' mark.

The pattern seems to involve the size and type of the shapes inside the larger shapes. Specifically, the shapes inside the larger shapes are increasing in size from left to right.

Given this pattern, the correct shape to fill the empty box should follow the pattern of increasing size and type of the shape inside the larger shape.

Looking at the options (A to F):

- A: Small hexagon inside a pentagon
- B: Small hexagon inside a pentagon
- C: Large hexagon inside a pentagon
- D: Small triangle inside a triangle
- E: Large hexagon inside a pentagon
- F: Small triangle inside a triangle

   - Middle row: Light square, light circle, light triangle.
   - Bottom row: Light square, light circle, light triangle.

2. **Analyze the pattern**:

3. **Determine the pattern for the empty box**:
   - The empty box is in the bottom row, third column.
   - The shape in the third column of the top row is a dark circle.
   - The shape in the third column of the middle row is a light triangle.

1. **Shape Analysis**:
   - The shapes include circles, squares, diamonds, pentagons, hexagons, and triangles.

4. **Diagonal Analysis**:
   - **First Diagonal**: The shapes include a circle, a gray diamond, and a black pentagon.
   - **Second Diagonal**: The shapes include a gray square, a gray pentagon, and a black pentagon.

Given the complexity and randomness of the arrangement, it's challenging to discern a clear pattern. However, focusing on the third column, we see a consistent shape: pentagons. This suggests that the pattern might involve repeating the same shape in each column.

5. **Shape Consistency**:
   - The third column has three pentagons. This suggests that the pattern might involve repeating the same shape in each column.

Therefore, the correct answer should be a shape that can consistently fill the empty box in the third column.
