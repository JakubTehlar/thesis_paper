0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_oc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9869_test.png,D,E,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern of the shapes in the grid. The shapes include pentagons, squares, and triangles, and they are arranged in a specific manner. Let's break down the pattern:

1. **Identify the shapes in each row:**
   - Row 1: Triangles, squares, pentagons
   - Row 2: Triangles, squares, pentagons
   - Row 3: Triangles, squares, pentagons

2. **Identify the orientation and shading of the shapes:**
   - The shapes vary in orientation (upright or inverted) and shading (light or dark).

3. **Determine the pattern:**
   - The shapes alternate between different orientations and shading.
   - The pattern seems to follow a sequence where the shapes change orientation and shading in a systematic way.

4. **Analyze the empty box:**
   - The empty box is in the second column of the third row.
   - The shape to the left of the empty box is a light, upright pentagon.
   - The shape above the empty box is a dark, inverted triangle.

5. **Match the pattern:**
   - Following the pattern, the shape to the right of the dark, inverted triangle should be a dark, upright pentagon.

Based on this analysis, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a dark, upright pentagon.

The correct answer is: E"

",False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box and determine the rule governing their arrangement.

1. **Top Row**: 
   - Box 1: Single diamond
   - Box 2: Single triangle
   - Box 3: Two diamonds

2. **Middle Row**:
   - Box 1: Three diamonds
   - Box 2: Two squares and one diamond
   - Box 3: Two triangles and one diamond

3. **Bottom Row**:
   - Box 1: Three squares

### Top Row:
- The shapes are: empty triangle, empty triangle, empty triangle.
- The pattern here seems to be three identical empty triangles.

### Middle Row:
- The shapes are: filled square, filled square, filled square.
- The pattern here seems to be three identical filled squares.

### Bottom Row:
- The shapes are: filled diamond, filled diamond, empty cross.

3,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_oc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9697_val.png,G,C,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the patterns in the 3x3 grid and determine how the shapes are arranged. Let's break down the patterns step-by-step:

1. **Shape Rotation**: The shapes in the grid are rotated versions of each other. For example, a hexagon can be rotated to different positions, and a square can also be rotated.

2. **Shape Transformation**: Some shapes are filled with different shades, but this does not seem to be the primary pattern. Instead, the focus is on the shape's outline and its rotation.

3. **Column Analysis**:
   - **First Column**: Contains a filled square, a filled hexagon, and a filled circle.
   - **Second Column**: Contains an empty square, a filled hexagon, and a filled circle.
   - **Third Column**: Contains a filled square, an empty hexagon, and a filled circle.

4. **Row Analysis**:
   - **First Row**: Contains a filled square, a filled hexagon, and a filled circle.
   - **Second Row**: Contains a filled square, a filled hexagon, and a filled circle.
   - **Third Row**: Contains a filled square, an empty hexagon, and a filled circle.

5. **Diagonal Analysis**:
   - **First Diagonal**: Contains a filled square, a filled hexagon, and a filled circle.
   - **Second Diagonal**: Contains a filled square, a filled hexagon, and a filled circle.

Given these observations, the pattern seems to be that each column and row must contain one square, one hexagon, and one circle. The empty box in the third column and second row needs to be filled with a shape that completes this pattern.

6. **Filling the Empty Box**:
   - The first column has a filled square, a filled hexagon, and a filled circle.
   - The second column has an empty square, a filled hexagon, and a filled circle.
   - The third column has a filled square, an empty hexagon, and a filled circle.

To complete the pattern, the empty box in the third column and second row should be a filled hexagon.

1. Top row: three squares (one filled, two empty)
2. Middle row: three pentagons (one filled, two empty)
3. Bottom row: three hexagons (one filled, two empty)

The empty box is in the middle row and the middle column. We need to determine which shape from the options A to F fits this pattern.
