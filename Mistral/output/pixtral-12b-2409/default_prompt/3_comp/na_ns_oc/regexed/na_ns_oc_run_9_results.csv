0,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_up_center_single_down_center_single_RAVEN_256_val.png,E,C,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the pattern in the 3x3 grid. Here is the grid for reference:

```
[ . ] [ . ] [ . ]
[ . ] [ . ] [ . ]
[ . ] [ . ] [ . ]
```

Let's examine the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: Hexagon, Hexagon, Circle
2. Middle row: Pentagon, Square, Pentagon
3. Bottom row: Triangle, Hexagon, Hexagon

Now, let's look at the options provided:

A. Square
B. Square
C. Circle
D. Pentagon
E. Pentagon
F. Triangle

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern that connects all the shapes. One possible pattern could be the shape's orientation or arrangement. However, in this case, the shapes seem to be randomly arranged without a clear pattern based on orientation or arrangement.

Given the random arrangement, the most logical approach is to fill the empty box with the shape that completes the pattern in terms of the number of shapes present in the grid.

The top row has three shapes: Hexagon, Hexagon, Circle.
The middle row has three shapes: Pentagon, Square, Pentagon.
The bottom row has three shapes: Triangle, Hexagon, Hexagon.

To maintain the pattern, we should choose a shape that appears in the grid. The shapes present are Hexagon, Pentagon, Circle, Square, and Triangle.

Since the empty box is in the top row, which has two Hexagons and one Circle, we should choose a shape that completes the pattern. The Circle is already present, so we should choose a Hexagon.

Therefore, the correct answer is a Hexagon, which corresponds to option C.

The correct answer is: C"
1,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_80_train.png,D,A,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the grid. The grid is 3x3, with one empty box marked with a question mark (?). The shapes in the boxes are circles, triangles, and hexagons, each in different shades of gray.

Let's break down the patterns:

1. **Horizontal Pattern:**
   - Row 1: Circle, Circle, Circle
   - Row 2: Triangle, Triangle, Triangle
   - Row 3: Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon

2. **Vertical Pattern:**
   - Column 1: Dark Circle, Dark Triangle, Dark Hexagon
   - Column 2: Light Circle, Light Triangle, Light Hexagon
   - Column 3: Dark Circle, Dark Triangle, Dark Hexagon

3. **Diagonal Pattern:**
   - Diagonal from top-left to bottom-right: Dark Circle, Light Triangle, Dark Hexagon
   - Diagonal from top-right to bottom-left: Dark Circle, Light Triangle, Dark Hexagon

4. **Empty Box Analysis:**
   - The empty box is in the third column and the second row.

Given the patterns, the empty box should follow the pattern of the second row, which is filled with triangles. Additionally, the third column alternates between dark and light shapes. Since the third column has a dark triangle in the first row and a light triangle in the third row, the empty box should have a dark triangle.

Therefore, the correct answer is a dark triangle.

The correct answer is: A"
2,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_195_train.png,H,F,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects all the shapes in the grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon.

From this, we can see that the pattern alternates between a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon.

Now, let's look at the empty box in the grid. It is located in the bottom row, which follows the pattern of a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon.

Following the pattern:
- The first box in the bottom row is a circle.
- The second box in the bottom row is a triangle.
- The third box in the bottom row should be a hexagon.

Therefore, the correct shape to fill the empty box is a hexagon.

    - Pattern: The shapes alternate between triangles and pentagons.

12. **Ninth Column:**
    - Shapes: Pentagon, Triangle, Hexagon
    - Pattern: The shapes are different and do not follow a specific pattern based on shape type.

From the above analysis, it appears that the pattern alternates between triangles and pentagons in the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth columns. Therefore, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a triangle.

The correct answer is: A

4,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_in_center_single_out_center_single_RAVEN_388_test.png,F,E,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern in the 3x3 grid of shapes. Each shape in the grid has a specific characteristic that changes systematically. Let's break down the elements:

1. **Shape Transformation**:
   - The shapes in the grid include circles, hexagons, pentagons, squares, and triangles.
   - The central feature of each shape is a dot or a small circle.

2. **Positional Changes**:
   - The position of the dot within the shapes varies. In some shapes, the dot is at the center, while in others, it is off-center.

3. **Shape Rotation**:
   - Some shapes are rotated compared to others.

Given these observations, let's identify the pattern:
- The shapes transition from one type to another systematically.
- The dot's position and the shape's orientation change in a specific order.

Now, let's match the given options (A to F) with the pattern observed in the grid:

- **A**: Small diamond with a dot at the top.
- **B**: Large diamond with a dot at the top.
- **C**: Small diamond with a black pentagon inside.
- **D**: Small diamond with a black triangle inside.
- **E**: Small diamond with a dot at the center.
- **F**: Large diamond with a dot at the center.

By comparing the shapes in the grid with the options, we can see that the pattern involves changing the size and position of the dot within a diamond shape.

The correct answer is: **E**

The empty box is in the bottom-right corner, marked with a question mark (?).

Now, let's examine the shapes in the grid to find a pattern:
- The shapes transition from circles to pentagons to triangles horizontally.
- The contents inside the shapes change in a specific pattern as well.

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern for the bottom-right box:
- The top-right box (triangle with a dot inside) suggests that the shape should be a triangle.
- The contents inside the shapes change in a specific pattern: dots, squares, and then back to dots.

Following this pattern, the correct shape for the bottom-right box should be a triangle with two dots inside.
