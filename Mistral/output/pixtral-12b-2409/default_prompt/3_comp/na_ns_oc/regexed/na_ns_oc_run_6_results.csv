",False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the pattern in the 3x3 grid. The shapes in the grid are arranged in a specific sequence, and we need to determine the rule governing this sequence.

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - Top row: Hexagon, Hexagon, Circle
   - Middle row: Pentagon, Square, Pentagon
   - Bottom row: Triangle, Hexagon, Circle

2. **Analyze the pattern:**
   - The shapes alternate between different types: Hexagon, Pentagon, Circle.
   - The sequence seems to follow a pattern where each shape type appears once in each row.

3. **Determine the missing shape:**
   - The empty box is in the middle row, third column.
   - The shapes in the middle row are: Pentagon, Square, ?
   - To maintain the pattern, the missing shape should be a Circle.

4. **Verify the pattern with the correct answer:**
   - Top row: Hexagon, Hexagon, Circle
   - Middle row: Pentagon, Square, Circle
   - Bottom row: Triangle, Hexagon, Circle

Thus, the correct answer is the shape that completes the pattern, ensuring each row has one of each shape type: Hexagon, Pentagon, Circle.

The correct answer is: **C**

1,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_80_train.png,D,**C**.,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern in the grid and determine how the shapes are arranged. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Shapes and Their Arrangement**:
   - The grid has shapes arranged in a 3x3 matrix, with one empty box marked by a question mark (?).
   - The shapes include circles, squares, triangles, and hexagons, each in various orientations and shades.

2. **Determine the Pattern**:
   - The pattern could be based on the type of shape, the orientation (upright or inverted), the shade (black or white), or a combination of these factors.

3. **Analyze Each Row and Column**:
   - **First Row**: Circle, Circle, Hexagon
   - **Second Row**: Triangle, Square, Triangle
   - **Third Row**: Circle, Hexagon, Square

   - **First Column**: Circle, Triangle, Circle
   - **Second Column**: Circle, Square, Triangle
   - **Third Column**: Hexagon, Triangle, Square

4. **Identify the Pattern**:
   - The pattern seems to alternate between shapes and their orientations. For example, in the first column, the shapes alternate between circles and triangles, and in the second column, they alternate between circles and squares.

5. **Determine the Shape for the Empty Box**:
   - The empty box is in the third column and the second row.
   - The third column has shapes: Hexagon, Triangle, Square.
   - The second row has shapes: Triangle, Square, Triangle.
   - The pattern alternates between triangles and squares in the second row.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The shape that fits the pattern in the empty box is a triangle.

The correct answer is: **C**."
2,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_195_train.png,H,C,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects all the shapes in the grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon.

From this, we can see that each row contains the same three shapes: a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon. This suggests that the pattern involves repeating these three shapes in each row.

Given the options A to F, we need to find which shape fits the pattern. Let's examine each option:

- **A**: Circle
- **B**: Triangle
- **C**: Hexagon
- **D**: Circle
- **E**: Triangle
- **F**: Hexagon

Since the pattern involves repeating the circle, triangle, and hexagon in each row, the correct answer must be one of these three shapes.

The empty box is in the middle row, which already contains a circle and a triangle. Therefore, the missing shape should be a hexagon to complete the pattern.

Thus, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is: C"

",False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. Top row: 
   - Box 1: Hexagon
   - Box 2: Pentagon
   - Box 3: Pentagon

2. Middle row:
   - Box 1: Pentagon
   - Box 2: Pentagon
   - Box 3: Triangle

3. Bottom row:
   - Box 1: Triangle
   - Box 2: Pentagon
   - Box 3: Pentagon

Next, let's look at the shapes in the columns:

1. Column 1:
   - Top: Hexagon
   - Middle: Pentagon
   - Bottom: Triangle

2. Column 2:
   - Top: Pentagon
   - Middle: Pentagon
   - Bottom: Pentagon

3. Column 3:
   - Top: Pentagon
   - Middle: Triangle
   - Bottom: Pentagon

Now, let's analyze the rows and columns for any consistent patterns:

- Row Pattern:
  - Top row: Hexagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
  - Middle row: Pentagon, Pentagon, Triangle
  - Bottom row: Triangle, Pentagon, Pentagon

- Column Pattern:
  - Column 1: Hexagon, Pentagon, Triangle
  - Column 2: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
  - Column 3: Pentagon, Triangle, Pentagon

From the above analysis, we can see that the pattern alternates between shapes. Specifically, the shapes in the top row and bottom row are different, while the middle row has the same shape in the first and third boxes.

Given the empty box is in the middle row and the third column, we need to determine which shape fits the pattern. The middle row has the same shape in the first and third boxes, which are both pentagons. Therefore, the shape that fits the pattern is a pentagon.

The correct answer is: C

4,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_in_center_single_out_center_single_RAVEN_388_test.png,F,**E**.,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern in the 3x3 grid. Each shape in the grid has a specific characteristic that changes systematically. Let's break down the shapes and their transformations:

1. **First Row:**
   - Shape 1: Circle inside a larger circle.
   - Shape 2: Hexagon with a filled circle.
   - Shape 3: Pentagon with a filled circle.

2. **Second Row:**
   - Shape 4: Pentagon with a small circle in the center.
   - Shape 5: Square with a small circle in the center.
   - Shape 6: Triangle with a small circle in the center.

3. **Third Row:**
   - Shape 7: Pentagon with a small circle in the center.
   - Shape 8: Pentagon with a small circle in the center.
   - Shape 9: Cross mark.

The pattern seems to involve the type of polygon and the position of the circle or dot within the polygon. To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern that fits the empty box.

Given the options A to H, let's analyze each:

- **A:** Diamond with a small circle at the top.
- **B:** Diamond with a small circle at the bottom.
- **C:** Diamond with a filled square at the bottom.
- **D:** Diamond with a filled triangle pointing down.
- **E:** Diamond with a small circle in the center.
- **F:** Diamond with a small circle in the center.
- **G:** Diamond with a filled square at the bottom.
- **H:** Diamond with a filled triangle pointing down.

The pattern in the grid seems to involve the position of the circle or filled shape within the diamond. The shapes in the grid have circles or filled shapes in different positions. The empty box should follow this pattern.

Given the options, the correct answer should be a diamond with a small circle in the center, which matches the pattern observed in the grid.

The correct answer is: **E**."

   - Pentagon with one dot inside.
   - Triangle with one dot inside.

3. **Third Row:**
   - Circle with two squares inside.
   - Pentagon with two dots inside.
   - Cross mark.

4. **Empty Box:**
   - The empty box is in the third column of the second row.

To determine the correct shape for the empty box, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the third column:

- **Third Column:**
   - First Row: Triangle with two dots inside.
   - Second Row: Empty box.
   - Third Row: Cross mark.

The pattern in the third column involves shapes with dots or marks inside them. The cross mark does not fit this pattern. Therefore, we need a shape with dots or marks inside it for the second row.

Among the options A to F, the shapes that fit this pattern are:
- A: Triangle with two dots inside.
- B: Triangle with two dots inside.
- C: Triangle with one dot inside.
- D: Triangle with two dots inside.
- E: Triangle with one dot inside.
- F: Triangle with one dot inside.

Since the first row and the third row both have triangles with two dots inside, the correct choice to maintain the pattern is a triangle with two dots inside.

The correct answer is: **D**."
