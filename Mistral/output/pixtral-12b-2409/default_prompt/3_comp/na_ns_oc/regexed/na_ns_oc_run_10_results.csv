1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - The shapes in the grid include circles, triangles (both upright and inverted), and hexagons.

2. **Analyze the pattern:**
   - The shapes are arranged in a way that suggests a transformation or relationship between them.
   - One possible pattern could be a rotation or reflection of the shapes.

3. **Examine the empty box:**
   - The empty box is located in the bottom row, second column.

4. **Determine the transformation:**
   - Let's look at the shapes around the empty box:
     - To the left of the empty box, there is a circle.
     - Above the empty box, there is a hexagon.
     - To the right of the empty box, there is a triangle.

5. **Apply the transformation:**
   - If we consider a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the circle to the left of the empty box would become the shape in the empty box.
   - Applying this rotation, the circle becomes a hexagon.

6. **Verify the pattern:**
   - Check if this transformation consistently applies to the other shapes in the grid.
   - The pattern holds true for the other shapes as well.

Therefore, the correct answer is the shape that results from rotating the circle 90 degrees clockwise, which is a hexagon.
