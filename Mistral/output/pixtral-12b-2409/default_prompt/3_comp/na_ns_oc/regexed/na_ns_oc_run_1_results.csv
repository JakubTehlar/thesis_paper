1,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_80_train.png,D,E,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the grid. The grid consists of shapes arranged in a 3x3 matrix, with one empty box marked by a question mark (?). The goal is to determine which shape from the options A to F correctly completes the pattern.

First, let's examine the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: Circle, Circle, Pentagon
2. Middle row: Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle
3. Bottom row: Triangle, Triangle, Triangle

Next, let's look at the shapes in the columns:

1. First column: Circle, Triangle, Triangle
2. Second column: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle
3. Third column: Pentagon, Triangle, Triangle

Now, let's analyze the patterns:

- The first column has a mix of shapes: Circle, Triangle, Triangle.
- The second column has a mix of shapes: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle.
- The third column has a mix of shapes: Pentagon, Triangle, Triangle.

It appears that the pattern alternates between different shapes in each column. Let's look at the rows:

- The first row has: Circle, Circle, Pentagon.
- The second row has: Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle.
- The third row has: Triangle, Triangle, Triangle.

It seems that the pattern in the rows is not consistent, but the third row has a repetition of the same shape (Triangle).

Given the complexity of the patterns, we need to focus on the shapes that are repeated and the alternation in the columns. The third column has a repetition of the Triangle shape, which suggests that the pattern might be focusing on the repetition of shapes in the columns.

Therefore, the correct answer should be the shape that maintains the pattern of repetition in the columns.

The correct answer is: **E**"
2,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_195_train.png,H,F,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon.

From the analysis, we can see that each row contains three different shapes: a circle, a triangle, and a hexagon. The pattern alternates the shapes in a consistent manner across the rows.

Given this pattern, the missing shape in the empty box should be one of the three shapes: a circle, a triangle, or a hexagon.

Since the question mark is in the bottom row, we need to determine which shape would complete the pattern. The bottom row already has a circle and a triangle, so the missing shape should be a hexagon to maintain the pattern.

Therefore, the correct answer is a hexagon.

The correct answer is: F."
3,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_distribute_four_RAVEN_68_test.png,F,C,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. Top-left box: Hexagon
2. Top-middle box: Pentagon

4. Middle-left box: Triangle pointing down
5. Middle-middle box: Pentagon
6. Middle-right box: Pentagon

Now, let's look at the options provided:

A. Triangle pointing up
B. Triangle pointing up
C. Pentagon
D. Pentagon
E. Triangle pointing up
F. Hexagon

To determine the pattern, we need to observe the sequence of shapes and identify any repeating or alternating patterns. The shapes alternate between pentagons and other shapes. Specifically, the sequence of shapes in the top row is Hexagon, Pentagon, Pentagon. The middle row is Triangle pointing down, Pentagon, Pentagon. The bottom row is Triangle pointing up, Pentagon, Hexagon.

Given this pattern, the empty box (middle-right box) should contain a Pentagon.

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and another hexagon. Each shape has a black dot in the center.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a pentagon with a white dot in the center, a square with a black dot in the center, and a triangle with a black dot in the center.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a pentagon with a black dot in the center, a hexagon with a black dot in the center, and another hexagon with a black dot in the center.

From this analysis, we can see that the shapes alternate between having a black dot and a white dot in the center. The pattern alternates between different polygonal shapes, including circles, hexagons, pentagons, squares, and triangles.

Given the options A to F, we need to find a shape that fits this pattern:

- **A**: A diamond with a black dot in the center.
- **B**: A diamond with a black dot in the center.
- **C**: A diamond with a black shape in the center.
- **D**: A diamond with a black triangle in the center.
- **E**: A diamond with a black dot in the center.

2. Middle row: Circle with a square, Pentagon with a square, Triangle with a dot.
3. Bottom row: Circle with two squares, Pentagon with two dots, Cross mark.

The pattern seems to involve the shapes and their internal features (dots, squares). We need to find a consistent transformation from one shape to another.

Let's examine the options A to F:

- **Option A**: Triangle with two dots.
- **Option B**: Triangle with two dots.
- **Option C**: Triangle with two dots.
- **Option D**: Triangle with two dots.
- **Option E**: Triangle with two dots.
- **Option F**: Triangle with two dots.

All options have triangles with two dots. We need to determine which one fits the pattern by looking at the sequence of transformations.

The sequence in the top row is:
- Circle with two dots → Pentagon with two dots → Triangle with two dots.

The sequence in the middle row is:
- Circle with a square → Pentagon with a square → Triangle with a dot.

The sequence in the bottom row is:
- Circle with two squares → Pentagon with two dots → Cross mark.

Given the pattern, the transformation from a Pentagon with two dots to a Triangle with two dots is consistent. Therefore, the correct answer should be a Triangle with two dots.

2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a large circle, a small pentagon, and a small circle.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a large triangle, a small triangle, and an 'X'.

Next, we examine the options provided (A to F) to find the correct shape that fits the pattern:

- **A**: A diamond shape.
- **B**: A filled triangle.
- **C**: A filled triangle.
- **D**: A diamond shape.
- **E**: A filled diamond.
- **F**: An empty triangle.
- **G**: A filled diamond.
- **H**: A filled diamond.

Given the arrangement and the shapes, we need to determine the pattern. The shapes in the grid include various geometric figures such as circles, triangles, and pentagons. The pattern might involve alternating between filled and unfilled shapes or between different geometric figures.

Upon closer inspection, the pattern seems to alternate between filled and unfilled shapes. The middle row has an unfilled triangle, and the bottom row has an unfilled triangle as well. Therefore, the correct shape should be an unfilled triangle to maintain the pattern.
