1. **First Row:**
   - Shapes: Circle, Hexagon, Circle
   - Pattern: Alternating between filled circles and hexagons.

2. **Second Row:**
   - Shapes: Hexagon, Hexagon, Cross
   - Pattern: Repeated hexagons followed by a cross.

3. **Third Row:**
   - Shapes: Circle, Hexagon, Circle
   - Pattern: Similar to the first row, alternating between filled circles and hexagons.

Now, let's look at the options (A to F) to see which one fits the pattern:

- **Option A:** Hexagon
- **Option B:** Circle
- **Option C:** Hexagon
- **Option D:** Circle
- **Option E:** Hexagon
- **Option F:** Circle

Given the pattern in the first and third rows, the empty box should be filled with a shape that alternates with the adjacent shapes. The first and third rows have alternating filled circles and hexagons. Therefore, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a circle.

1,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_ns_nc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9439_test.png,B,A,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the patterns in the shapes and their arrangement within the grid. Let's break down the elements:

1. **Shape Types**: The shapes include circles, triangles, and pentagons.
2. **Colors**: The shapes are either black, white, or gray.
3. **Arrangement**: The shapes are arranged in a specific pattern within each row and column.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Row**:
   - Shapes: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle
   - Colors: Gray, White, Black

2. **Second Row**:
   - Shapes: Pentagon, Circle, Triangle
   - Colors: Black, Gray, White

3. **Third Row**:
