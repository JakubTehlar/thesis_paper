1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a circle, a triangle, and a pentagon.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a pentagon, a circle, and a triangle.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a circle, and a pentagon.

Next, we need to look at the shapes in the columns:

1. **First Column**: The shapes are a circle, a circle, and a circle.
2. **Second Column**: The shapes are a pentagon, a triangle, and a triangle.
3. **Third Column**: The shapes are a triangle, a pentagon, and a pentagon.

Finally, we need to consider the shapes in the rows and columns:

- **First Row**: Circle, Triangle, Pentagon

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - Top row: Hexagon, Small circle, Hexagon
   - Middle row: Large circle, Small hexagon, Hexagon
   - Bottom row: Hexagon, Small circle, Hexagon

2. **Observe the pattern:**
   - The shapes alternate between hexagons and other shapes.
   - The sequence appears to be: Hexagon, Small circle, Hexagon, Large circle, Small hexagon, Hexagon.

3. **Determine the missing shape:**
   - The empty box is in the middle of the bottom row.
   - Following the pattern, the sequence should be: Hexagon, Small circle, Hexagon, Large circle, Small hexagon, Hexagon.
   - The previous shape in the sequence is a hexagon, so the next shape should be a Small circle.

4. **Match the pattern with the options:**
   - The options are: A (Small circle), B (Large circle), C (Small triangle), D (Large triangle), E (Inverted triangle), F (Small circle), G (Small circle), H (Small triangle).
   - The correct shape that fits the pattern is a Small circle.

2. Middle row: Circle with one triangle, Circle with two dots, Circle with one dot.
3. Bottom row: Circle with one dot, Hexagon with two dots, Hexagon with one dot.

Now, let's look at the options provided:

A. Hexagon with three dots
B. Square with one dot
C. Square with three dots
D. Square with two dots
E. Hexagon with three dots
F. Hexagon with one dot

To determine the pattern, we need to consider the shape and the number of dots or triangles within the shapes. The pattern might involve the number of sides, the type of shape, or the number of dots/triangles.

Observing the grid, we see:
- The shapes alternate between circles and hexagons.
- The number of dots/triangles varies.

Given the empty box is a circle, we need to find a shape that fits the pattern of alternating shapes and the number of dots/triangles.

Option A (Hexagon with three dots) does not fit because the empty box is a circle.
Option B (Square with one dot) does not fit because the empty box is a circle.
Option C (Square with three dots) does not fit because the empty box is a circle.
Option D (Square with two dots) does not fit because the empty box is a circle.
Option E (Hexagon with three dots) does not fit because the empty box is a circle.
Option F (Hexagon with one dot) does not fit because the empty box is a circle.

None of the options fit the pattern of the empty box being a circle. Therefore, we need to reconsider the pattern or the options provided.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the pattern involves the number of dots/triangles and the type of shape. The correct answer should be a circle with one dot, which is consistent with the pattern observed in the grid.
