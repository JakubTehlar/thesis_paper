2,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_ns_oc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9960_train.png,G,C,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the grid. The grid consists of nine boxes, each containing a shape. The shapes vary in form, color, and shading. The goal is to identify the pattern that connects all the shapes and determine which shape should fill the empty box.

Let's break down the patterns:

1. **Shape Form**: The shapes include circles, squares, triangles, and pentagons.
2. **Color**: The shapes are either black, gray, or white.
3. **Shading**: Some shapes are filled, while others are outlined.

To identify the pattern, we need to look at the sequence of shapes in each row and column.

**Row Analysis**:
- Row 1: Circle (black), Pentagon (gray), Square (black)
- Row 2: Pentagon (black), Triangle (gray), Pentagon (black)
- Row 3: Triangle (black), Circle (gray), Square (black)

**Column Analysis**:
- Column 1: Circle (black), Pentagon (black), Triangle (black)
- Column 2: Pentagon (gray), Triangle (gray), Circle (gray)
- Column 3: Square (black), Pentagon (black), Square (black)

**Pattern Identification**:
- The pattern seems to involve alternating between filled and outlined shapes.
- The shapes in the first row are all filled.
- The shapes in the second row alternate between filled and outlined.
- The shapes in the third row are all filled.

Given this pattern, the empty box in the third column should have a filled shape.

**Shape Selection**:
- The options for the third column are A, C, E, and G.
- Option A: Circle (filled, black)
- Option C: Pentagon (filled, black)
- Option E: Triangle (filled, black)
- Option G: Circle (filled, black)

Since the pattern involves filled shapes and the third column already has a filled black circle (option A), the next filled black shape would be a filled black pentagon.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

```

First, let's look at the shapes in the top row:
- Shape A (dark hexagon)
- Shape B (light pentagon)
- Shape C (light hexagon)

Next, the middle row:
- Shape D (dark pentagon)
- Shape E (dark hexagon)
- Shape F (light hexagon)

Finally, the bottom row:
- Shape G (dark hexagon)
- Shape H (light pentagon)

Now, let's identify the pattern. One possible pattern could be alternating between dark and light shapes. However, this doesn't hold true for all rows. Another pattern could be alternating between hexagons and pentagons. Let's check this:

- Top row: Hexagon, Pentagon, Hexagon
- Middle row: Pentagon, Hexagon, Hexagon
- Bottom row: Hexagon, Pentagon, ?

1. Top row: Hexagon, Pentagon, Square
2. Middle row: Irregular Hexagon, Square, Triangle
3. Bottom row: Circle, Hexagon, Cross

Next, let's look at the options provided (A to F):

- A: Hexagon with two dots
- B: Hexagon with one dot
- C: Hexagon with two dots
- D: Hexagon with one dot
- E: Hexagon with two dots
- F: Hexagon with one dot

Now, let's analyze the pattern in the grid:

1. The shapes vary in form (hexagon, pentagon, square, triangle, circle, cross).
2. The arrangement of dots within the shapes also varies.

Given the variety in shapes and dot arrangements, the pattern might be related to the number of dots or the shape itself. However, the shapes are not consistent in form, so the focus should be on the dot arrangement.

Let's examine the dot arrangements in the grid:

1. Top row: Hexagon (2 dots), Pentagon (1 dot), Square (1 dot)
2. Middle row: Irregular Hexagon (3 dots), Square (2 dots), Triangle (1 dot)
3. Bottom row: Circle (1 dot), Hexagon (3 dots), Cross (0 dots)

From this, we can see that the number of dots varies, but there is no consistent pattern in the number of dots alone.

Given the complexity and variety in the shapes and dot arrangements, the pattern might be more abstract or based on a less obvious rule. However, the most consistent pattern appears to be the presence of hexagons with varying dot arrangements.

Since the empty box is a hexagon, the most logical choice would be to match the dot arrangement of the adjacent hexagons. The adjacent hexagons have 2 dots, 3 dots, and 3 dots respectively.

Therefore, the correct answer should be a hexagon with 3 dots.
