1,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_ns_oc_up_center_single_down_center_single_RAVEN_9916_val.png,A,D,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects all the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each row and column.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Row:**
   - Shapes: Circle, Triangle, Square
   - Pattern: The shapes are different geometric figures.

2. **Second Row:**
   - Shapes: Diamond, Circle, Triangle
   - Pattern: The shapes are different geometric figures.

3. **Third Row:**
   - Shapes: Triangle, Diamond, Circle
   - Pattern: The shapes are different geometric figures.

4. **First Column:**
   - Shapes: Circle, Diamond, Triangle
   - Pattern: The shapes are different geometric figures.

5. **Second Column:**
   - Shapes: Triangle, Circle, Diamond
   - Pattern: The shapes are different geometric figures.

6. **Third Column:**
