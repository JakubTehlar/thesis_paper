2,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_ns_oc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9960_train.png,G,C,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the grid. The grid consists of shapes arranged in a 3x3 matrix, with one empty box marked by a question mark (?). The goal is to identify the correct shape from the options A to F that completes the pattern.

Let's break down the patterns:

1. **Shape Transformation**:
   - The shapes vary in form and color.
   - There is a progression from simple to complex shapes.
   - The colors range from light to dark shades.

2. **Row and Column Analysis**:
   - **First Row**: The shapes are a square, triangle, pentagon, hexagon, and circle.
   - **Second Row**: The shapes are a pentagon, hexagon, and circle.
   - **Third Row**: The shapes are a triangle, square, and circle.

3. **Color Analysis**:
   - The colors range from light gray to black.
   - The first column has a light gray square, dark gray triangle, and medium gray circle.
   - The second column has a light gray pentagon, dark gray hexagon, and black circle.
   - The third column has a dark gray triangle, light gray square, and medium gray circle.

4. **Shape Progression**:
   - The shapes seem to transition from simple to complex forms.
   - The colors also transition from light to dark.

Given these observations, let's determine the pattern:

- The first column has a square, triangle, and circle.
- The second column has a pentagon, hexagon, and circle.
- The third column has a triangle, square, and circle.

Considering the progression from simple to complex shapes and the color transition, the missing shape should be a pentagon, which fits the pattern of the second column.

The correct answer is: C"
3,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_ns_oc_distribute_four_RAVEN_9991_train.png,A,E.,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects all the shapes in the grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. Top row: Hexagon, Square, Pentagon
2. Middle row: Hexagon, Square, Pentagon
3. Bottom row: Hexagon, Square, Pentagon

We can see that each row contains three different shapes: a hexagon, a square, and a pentagon. The pattern alternates the shapes in a specific order.

Next, let's look at the shapes in the columns:

1. First column: Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon
2. Second column: Square, Square, Square
3. Third column: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon

Here, each column contains the same shape repeated three times.

Finally, let's look at the diagonal:

1. Diagonal from top-left to bottom-right: Hexagon, Square, Pentagon
2. Diagonal from top-right to bottom-left: Pentagon, Square, Hexagon

Both diagonals contain the same sequence of shapes: Hexagon, Square, Pentagon.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the pattern involves repeating the same shape in each column and alternating the shapes in each row. Since the empty box is in the third column, it should contain a Pentagon.

Therefore, the correct answer is the shape labeled as E.

The correct answer is: E."

1. Top-left hexagon: square, circle, triangle
2. Bottom-left hexagon: circle, triangle, diamond
3. Bottom-right hexagon: circle, triangle

We can see that the hexagons contain a mix of shapes, but the common pattern seems to be the presence of the circle in each hexagon. Additionally, the circle appears in various other shapes (square, triangle, diamond) in the grid.

The shapes in the grid are arranged in a specific sequence. Observing the pattern, we see that each shape is followed by the next shape in the sequence: Circle → Diamond → Triangle → Circle → Diamond → Triangle → Circle → Diamond → Triangle.

2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a pentagon with a triangle inside, a diamond with a small square inside, and a hexagon with a small circle inside.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a hexagon with a triangle inside, a diamond with a small square inside, and a pentagon with a small circle inside.

- **D**: Diamond with a black circle inside
- **E**: Diamond with a white triangle pointing up
- **F**: Diamond with a white circle inside
- **G**: Diamond with a black triangle pointing right
- **H**: Diamond with a white circle inside

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern that relates the shapes in the grid to the options. The shapes in the grid are all polygons with different internal shapes. The options are diamonds with different internal shapes.

Given the pattern, the correct answer should be a diamond with a white triangle pointing up, which matches the internal shapes in the middle row of the grid.

3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a circle, and a triangle pointing downwards.

From this, we can observe the following patterns:

- The direction of the triangle alternates between pointing downwards and upwards.

Given that the empty box is in the middle row, we need to determine the correct shape for the middle row's third position. The pattern suggests that the third shape should be a triangle pointing upwards, as the previous two triangles in the middle row point downwards.

3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a pentagon, a circle, a small pentagon, a small circle, a pentagon, a small pentagon, and a pentagon.

To find the pattern, we need to look at the transformations or relationships between the shapes in the grid. One possible pattern could be the size or type of the shapes.

Let's examine the shapes in the grid:
- The top row has a mix of different shapes.
- The middle row has a mix of different shapes.
- The bottom row has a mix of different shapes.

Given the variety of shapes, it seems the pattern might be based on the shape type rather than size or color.

- Middle Row: Hexagon, Triangle, Diamond
- Bottom Row: Pentagon, Diamond, Pentagon

The pattern in the rows suggests that the first and last shapes are the same, and the middle shape is different.

Given this pattern, the empty box in the middle row should be filled with a shape that follows the pattern of the top and bottom rows. The top row ends with a Hexagon, and the bottom row starts with a Pentagon. Therefore, the middle row should have a shape that fits this pattern.
