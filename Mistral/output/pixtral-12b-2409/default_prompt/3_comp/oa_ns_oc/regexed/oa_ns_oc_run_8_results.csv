1. **First Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a filled hexagon, and a half-filled hexagon.
2. **Second Row**: The shapes are a diamond, a circle, and a triangle.
3. **Third Row**: The shapes are a circle, a square, and a triangle.

Now, let's look at the columns:

1. **First Column**: The shapes are a hexagon, a diamond, and a circle.
2. **Second Column**: The shapes are a filled hexagon, a circle, and a circle.
3. **Third Column**: The shapes are a half-filled hexagon, a triangle, and a square.

To determine the pattern, we need to look for a consistent transformation or relationship among the shapes. One possible pattern could be the transformation of shapes from one form to another. For example, a hexagon could be transformed into a diamond, then into a circle, and so on.

Given the shapes in the grid, let's analyze the empty box in the third row and second column:

- The shape above it in the second row is a circle.
- The shape to the left of it in the second column is a circle.

Since both the shape above and the shape to the left are circles, the pattern suggests that the empty box should also contain a circle.

Therefore, the correct answer is a circle.

- A: Diamond with a filled circle
- B: Diamond with a filled triangle pointing down
- C: Diamond with an empty triangle pointing up
- D: Diamond with a filled circle
- E: Diamond with an empty triangle pointing up
- F: Diamond with an empty circle

Now, let's analyze the pattern in the grid:

1. The shapes in the grid are varied: squares, hexagons, pentagons, and diamonds.
2. The shapes in the bottom row of options are all diamonds with different fillings or empty shapes.

Given that the grid contains a mix of shapes, the pattern might be related to the fillings or the orientation of the shapes. However, the shapes in the grid do not follow a consistent pattern of fillings or orientations.

Considering the options, the pattern seems to be the type of shape inside the diamond. The shapes in the grid include triangles (both filled and empty) and circles (both filled and empty). Among the options, the shapes inside the diamonds are triangles and circles.

Since the grid includes both filled and empty triangles and circles, the pattern could be the alternation of these shapes. The shapes in the grid are:

- Top row: Square, Hexagon, Pentagon
- Middle row: Pentagon, Diamond with empty triangle, Hexagon
- Bottom row: Pentagon, Hexagon, Square

The shapes inside the diamonds in the middle row are an empty triangle and an empty circle. Therefore, the pattern alternates between filled and empty shapes.

Given this pattern, the correct answer should be a diamond with an empty circle, which matches the pattern of alternating between filled and empty shapes.

2. The shapes vary in size and shape.

Let's analyze the grid:
- Top row: Dark, Light, Dark
- Middle row: Dark, Light, Dark
- Bottom row: Light, Dark, ?

Following the pattern of alternating light and dark shapes, the bottom row should have a dark shape. Among the options, the dark shapes are A, C, E, and F.

Next, we need to consider the size and shape variation:
- The top row has a large dark pentagon (A) and a large light circle (B).
- The middle row has a large dark circle (E) and a small dark circle (F).

Given these observations, the bottom row should have a dark shape that is neither too large nor too small. The options that fit this criterion are C (dark small pentagon) and F (dark small circle).

Since the pattern alternates between different shapes, and considering the placement of pentagons and circles, the correct choice should be a dark small pentagon (C).
