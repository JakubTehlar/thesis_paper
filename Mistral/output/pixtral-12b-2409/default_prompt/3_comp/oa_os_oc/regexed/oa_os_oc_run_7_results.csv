0,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_os_oc_center_single_RAVEN_9918_test.png,D,D,True,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: pentagon, irregular pentagon, circle
2. Middle row: circle, hexagon, irregular pentagon
3. Bottom row: pentagon, circle, cross

Next, let's look at the options provided:

- A: Large triangle
- B: Small pentagon
- C: Small hexagon
- D: Large hexagon
- E: Large triangle
- F: Large hexagon

To determine the pattern, we need to consider the shape transformations or relationships between the shapes. One possible pattern could be the transformation from a pentagon to a circle, then to a hexagon, and finally to a cross.

Let's break down the pattern step-by-step:

1. Top row: pentagon → irregular pentagon → circle
2. Middle row: circle → hexagon → irregular pentagon
3. Bottom row: pentagon → circle → cross

The pattern seems to involve a transformation from a pentagon to a circle, then to a hexagon, and finally to a cross. Given this pattern, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a hexagon.

The correct answer is: D

   - Middle row: Circle, Triangle, Circle, Pentagon, Circle, Circle, Pentagon
   - Bottom row: Pentagon, Circle, Pentagon, Circle, Pentagon, Circle, Pentagon

2. **Determine the pattern:**
   - The shapes alternate between different types (hexagon, triangle, pentagon, circle).
   - The pattern seems to follow a sequence where shapes of the same type are not adjacent.

3. **Analyze the empty cell:**
   - The empty cell is in the middle of the grid.
   - The shapes directly above and below the empty cell are circles.
   - The shapes to the left and right of the empty cell are pentagons.

4. **Identify the correct shape:**
   - Since the shapes above and below are circles, and the shapes to the left and right are pentagons, the empty cell should contain a shape that is neither a circle nor a pentagon.
   - The possible shapes are hexagon and triangle.

5. **Check the pattern consistency:**
   - The top row has a hexagon in the first and fourth cells.
   - The middle row has a triangle in the second cell.
   - The bottom row has a hexagon in the first and fourth cells.

Given this analysis, the correct shape to fill the empty cell should be a triangle to maintain the alternating pattern and avoid adjacency of the same type of shapes.

6,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_os_oc_distribute_four_RAVEN_9716_val.png,G,D,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the patterns in the grid. The grid consists of different shapes and colors arranged in a specific manner. Let's break down the patterns:

1. **Shape Pattern**: The shapes in the grid include squares, circles, triangles, and hexagons. We need to determine if there is a sequence or alternation among these shapes.

2. **Color Pattern**: The shapes are also in different shades of gray and black. We need to identify if there is a pattern in the color distribution.

3. **Position Pattern**: The shapes are arranged in a 3x3 grid. We need to check if there is a positional pattern that repeats or alternates.

Let's analyze the grid row by row:

- **First Row**: Square, Circle, Triangle
- **Second Row**: Circle, Hexagon, Circle
- **Third Row**: Triangle, Circle, Hexagon
