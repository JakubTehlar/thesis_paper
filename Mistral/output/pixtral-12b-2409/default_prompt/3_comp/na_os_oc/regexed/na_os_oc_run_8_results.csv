1. Top row: Hexagon with triangle, Square with triangle, Circle with triangle
2. Middle row: Circle with square, Hexagon with square, Square with square
3. Bottom row: Diamond with circle, Circle with circle, Hexagon with circle, Cross

First, let's identify the shapes in the empty box:
- The shapes in the top row have a triangle inside.
- The shapes in the middle row have a square inside.
- The shapes in the bottom row have a circle inside.

Next, let's look at the shapes themselves:
- The shapes in the first column are a hexagon, circle, and diamond.
- The shapes in the second column are a square, hexagon, and circle.

- B: Pentagon with a triangle and a square
- C: Pentagon with a triangle
- D: Pentagon with a diamond
- E: Hexagon with a triangle
- F: Square with a triangle

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern. One possible pattern could be the shape of the box itself (square, pentagon, hexagon) and the type of figure inside (triangle, square, diamond).

Observing the grid, we see:
- The top row has shapes with a triangle and a square.
- The middle row has shapes with a diamond.
- The bottom row has shapes with a triangle.

Given that the empty box is in the bottom row, the shape inside should be a triangle. The shape of the box itself alternates between pentagon and hexagon.

Since the previous box (Box 8) is a pentagon with a triangle, the next box (Box 9) should be a hexagon with a triangle.

Therefore, the correct answer is the hexagon with a triangle, which is option E.

2. **Second Row:**
   - Shapes: Circle, Square, Circle
   - Pattern: The shapes alternate between Circle and Square.

3. **Third Row:**
   - Shapes: Circle, Triangle, Square
   - Pattern: The shapes alternate between Circle and Triangle.

4. **First Column:**

1. Top row: pentagon, pentagon, pentagon
2. Middle row: pentagon, pentagon, circle
3. Bottom row: circle, circle, X

Next, let's look at the options provided:

- A: Circle
- B: Black triangle
- C: Circle
- D: Black circle
- E: Black circle
- F: White triangle
- G: Black triangle
- H: White triangle

We need to determine which shape completes the pattern. Observing the grid, we see that the shapes alternate between pentagons and circles. The empty box is in the bottom row, which currently has two circles. Therefore, the pattern suggests that the next shape should be a pentagon.

Among the options, the only pentagon is option H (white triangle). However, this does not fit the pattern of alternating between pentagons and circles. Therefore, we need to reconsider the pattern.

Upon closer inspection, we notice that the shapes in the grid are alternating between filled and unfilled shapes. The top row has filled pentagons, the middle row has unfilled pentagons and circles, and the bottom row has unfilled circles and an X.

Given this, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be an unfilled shape. The options that fit this criterion are A, C, F, and H. Since the pattern alternates between pentagons and circles, and the bottom row has two circles, the next shape should be a pentagon.

Therefore, the correct answer is the unfilled pentagon, which is option H.

2. Middle row: Triangle with dot, Pentagon with square, Circle with triangle.
3. Bottom row: Triangle with triangle, Pentagon with dot, Circle with cross.

The pattern seems to involve a sequence of shapes and symbols. Let's break it down:

- The first column has a triangle with a square, a triangle with a dot, and a triangle with a triangle.
- The second column has a pentagon with a triangle, a pentagon with a square, and a pentagon with a dot.
- The third column has a circle with a dot, a circle with a triangle, and a circle with a cross.

To find the correct answer, we need to look for a consistent pattern in the shapes and symbols. Observing the sequence, it appears that the shapes alternate between triangles, pentagons, and circles, and the symbols within the shapes also change in a specific order.

Let's analyze the symbols:
- Top row: Square, Triangle, Dot.
- Middle row: Dot, Square, Triangle.
- Bottom row: Triangle, Dot, Cross.

The sequence of symbols seems to be: Square, Triangle, Dot, Dot, Square, Triangle, Triangle, Dot, Cross.
