### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Row:**
   - Shapes: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle
   - Pattern: The shapes are different in each box.

2. **Second Row:**
   - Shapes: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
   - Pattern: The shapes are the same in each box.

3. **Third Row:**
   - Shapes: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
   - Pattern: The shapes are the same in each box.

4. **First Column:**
   - Shapes: Circle, Pentagon, Pentagon
   - Pattern: The shapes are different in each box.

5. **Second Column:**
   - Shapes: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
   - Pattern: The shapes are the same in each box.

6. **Third Column:**
   - Shapes: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
   - Pattern: The shapes are the same in each box.

### Identifying the Pattern:
- The pattern seems to be that the second and third rows have the same shape in each box, while the first row has different shapes.
- The second and third columns also have the same shape in each box.

Given this, the pattern suggests that the empty box should have the same shape as the shapes in the second and third rows and columns.

### Conclusion:
- The shapes in the second and third rows and columns are all pentagons.

Therefore, the correct answer is a pentagon.

1. **Identify the shapes in the top row**: The top row has pentagons, squares, and triangles arranged in a specific order.
2. **Identify the shapes in the middle row**: The middle row follows a similar pattern but with a slight variation.
3. **Identify the shapes in the bottom row**: The bottom row continues the pattern but with another variation.
4. **Identify the shapes in the right column**: The right column also follows a pattern.

First, let's look at the shapes in the top row:
- Hexagon, Pentagon, Triangle

Next, the middle row:
- Pentagon, Triangle, Inverted Triangle

Finally, the bottom row:

Now, let's identify the pattern:
- The top row has a mix of polygons (hexagon, pentagon, triangle).
- The middle row has a mix of polygons (pentagon, triangle, inverted triangle).
- The bottom row has a mix of circles and a square.

It appears that the pattern alternates between polygons and other shapes. Specifically, the first and second rows contain polygons, while the third row contains circles and a square.

Given this pattern, the empty box in the middle row should contain a polygon. The available options are:
- A: Circle
- B: Square
- C: Pentagon
