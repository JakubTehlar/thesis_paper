0,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9995_train.png,E,D,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the shapes and their arrangement within the grid. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the Shapes and Their Arrangement**:
   - The grid has eight shapes in it, with one empty box marked with a question mark (?).
   - The shapes include circles, triangles, and pentagons of varying shades.

2. **Analyze the Patterns**:
   - The shapes are arranged in a specific order in each row and column.
   - We need to determine if there is a pattern based on the shape type, size, or shading.

3. **Determine the Pattern**:
   - Let's look at the shapes in each row and column:
     - Row 1: Circle, Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle, Pentagon
     - Row 2: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
     - Row 3: Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle

   - Column 1: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle
   - Column 2: Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle
   - Column 3: Pentagon, Triangle, Pentagon
   - Column 4: Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle
   - Column 5: Pentagon, Triangle, Pentagon
   - Column 6: Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle
   - Column 7: Pentagon, Triangle, Pentagon
   - Column 8: Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle
   - Column 9: Pentagon, Triangle, Pentagon

4. **Identify the Empty Box**:
   - The empty box is in the third row and the ninth column.

5. **Match the Pattern**:
   - In the third row, the shapes alternate between triangles and pentagons.
   - The previous shape in the third row is a triangle.
   - Therefore, the next shape should be a pentagon.

6. **Select the Correct Shape**:
   - From the options A to F, we need to find a pentagon.
   - The correct shape is option D.

The correct answer is: D"
