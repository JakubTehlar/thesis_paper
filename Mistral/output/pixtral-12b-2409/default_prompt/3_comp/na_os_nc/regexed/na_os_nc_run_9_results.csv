0,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9995_train.png,E,F,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the grid. The grid consists of nine boxes with different shapes, and one box is empty. The goal is to determine which shape from the options A to F fits in the empty box.

Let's break down the patterns:

1. **Shape Types**: The shapes in the grid include circles, triangles, diamonds, and pentagons.
2. **Shape Arrangement**: The shapes are arranged in a specific pattern. We need to identify the rule governing this arrangement.

First, let's look at the rows and columns:

- **First Row**: Circle, Triangle, Pentagon
- **Second Row**: Triangle, Pentagon, Diamond
- **Third Row**: Pentagon, Diamond, Circle

Now, let's look at the columns:

- **First Column**: Circle, Triangle, Pentagon
- **Second Column**: Triangle, Pentagon, Diamond
- **Third Column**: Pentagon, Diamond, Circle

Next, let's analyze the patterns:

- **Shape Rotation**: Some shapes are rotated versions of others.
- **Shape Repetition**: Some shapes repeat in different positions.

Given these observations, the pattern seems to involve rotating shapes to fit into the empty box. Let's check each option:

- **Option A**: Circle
- **Option B**: Triangle
- **Option C**: Pentagon
- **Option D**: Diamond
- **Option E**: Circle (rotated)
- **Option F**: Triangle (rotated)

The correct answer should be a shape that fits the pattern of rotation and repetition. The empty box is in the third column, which currently has a circle, triangle, and diamond. The pattern suggests that the next shape should be a rotated version of one of these.

Given the options, the rotated triangle (Option F) fits the pattern best.

The correct answer is: F"

Each shape in the grid is composed of a larger geometric figure with a smaller geometric figure inside it. The shapes include pentagons, circles, and triangles, each containing a smaller square, triangle, or hexagon.

Let's break down the patterns:

1. **Top Row:**
   - Shape 1: Pentagon with a small square inside.
   - Shape 2: Pentagon with a small square inside.
   - Shape 3: Circle with a small triangle inside.

### Conclusion:
The pattern in the grid alternates between hexagons and either squares or circles. To fill the empty box, we need to determine the correct shape that fits this pattern.

Given the empty box is in the third column and second row, the shape should alternate with the hexagon above it. The shape above the empty box is a hexagon. Therefore, the shape that should fill the empty box should be a square.

",False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern in the 3x3 grid of shapes. The shapes in the grid are arranged in a specific sequence, and we must identify the rule governing this sequence.

Let's examine the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: Hexagon, Small Pentagon, Square
2. Middle row: Small Pentagon, Large Pentagon, Diamond
3. Bottom row: Large Pentagon, Small Square, Cross

Now, let's look at the options provided:

A. Small Square
B. Triangle
C. Small Square
D. Large Square
E. Large Square
F. Triangle
G. Small Triangle
H. Small Triangle

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the shapes' properties, such as their number of sides, orientation, and size.

Upon examining the sequence, we can see that the shapes alternate between polygons with different numbers of sides and different orientations. The shapes also vary in size.

Given this, we need to find a shape that fits this pattern. The sequence seems to alternate between polygons and triangles, and between filled and unfilled shapes.

The empty box in the grid is in the bottom row, third column. The shapes around it are a large pentagon and a cross. The cross can be seen as a special case, so we should focus on the large pentagon.

The next shape in the sequence should be a polygon with a different number of sides, and it should be a triangle to maintain the alternation pattern.

Therefore, the correct answer is a small triangle, which fits the pattern of alternating between different shapes and maintaining the sequence.

The correct answer is: G
