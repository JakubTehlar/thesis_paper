1. **First Column:**
   - Top: Circle
   - Middle: Pentagon
   - Bottom: Large Circle

2. **Second Column:**
   - Top: Pentagon
   - Middle: Pentagon
   - Bottom: Large Circle

3. **Third Column:**
   - Top: Pentagon
   - Middle: Pentagon

   - Right: Pentagon

5. **Second Row:**
   - Left: Pentagon
   - Middle: Pentagon
   - Right: Pentagon

6. **Third Row:**
   - Left: Large Circle
   - Middle: Large Circle
   - Right: Large Circle

From the analysis, we can see that the pattern involves the shapes changing in size and type. Specifically, the large circle appears consistently in the bottom row, and the pentagon appears consistently in the middle row. The left column alternates between a circle and a large circle.

Given this pattern, the empty box in the bottom row should be filled with a large circle.

The correct answer is: **G**

1,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_distribute_four_RAVEN_9999_test.png,G,A,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the patterns in the grid and the shapes provided in the options. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - The grid contains circles, hexagons, and squares.
   - The shapes are arranged in a specific pattern.

2. **Analyze the pattern:**
   - The top row has two circles and one hexagon.
   - The middle row has one circle, one hexagon, and one square.
   - The bottom row has one circle, one hexagon, and one square.

3. **Determine the rule:**
   - The pattern seems to alternate between shapes. Each row has a mix of shapes, and the sequence appears to follow a specific order.

4. **Examine the options:**
   - A: Two hexagons, two squares, one circle
   - B: Two hexagons, two squares, one circle
   - C: Two hexagons, two squares, one circle
   - D: Two hexagons, two squares, one circle
   - E: Two hexagons, two squares, one circle
   - F: Two hexagons, two squares, one circle

5. **Match the pattern:**
   - All options (A to F) have the same arrangement of shapes: two hexagons, two squares, and one circle.
   - Since the pattern in the grid alternates between shapes, any of the options A to F could fit the empty box.

Given the options provided, any of them could be correct based on the pattern observed. However, since the question asks for a single answer, we will choose one of the options.

The correct answer is: **A**."

3,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_in_center_single_out_center_single_RAVEN_9999_test.png,A,F,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. Top-left: A triangle with a square inside.
2. Top-middle: A pentagon with a triangle inside.
3. Top-right: A circle with a triangle inside.
4. Middle-left: A pentagon with a hexagon inside.
5. Middle-middle: A circle with a square inside.
6. Middle-right: A triangle with a square inside.
7. Bottom-left: A circle with a hexagon inside.
8. Bottom-middle: A triangle with a hexagon inside.
9. Bottom-right: A triangle with a square inside (marked with a question mark).

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the shapes and their transformations. Here are the possible transformations:
- Shape changes: square, triangle, circle, pentagon, hexagon.
- Position changes: inside, outside.

Let's analyze the sequence of shapes:
- From the top-left to the top-middle: Triangle to Pentagon.
- From the top-middle to the top-right: Pentagon to Circle.
- From the top-right to the middle-left: Circle to Pentagon.
- From the middle-left to the middle-middle: Pentagon to Circle.
- From the middle-middle to the middle-right: Circle to Triangle.
- From the middle-right to the bottom-left: Triangle to Circle.
- From the bottom-left to the bottom-middle: Circle to Triangle.
- From the bottom-middle to the bottom-right: Triangle to Triangle.

The pattern seems to involve alternating between different shapes and their positions. The empty box (bottom-right) has a triangle with a square inside. The previous box (bottom-middle) has a triangle with a hexagon inside. Following the pattern, the next shape should be a triangle with a square inside.

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a triangle (pointing down), a circle, and a hexagon.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a triangle (pointing up), a circle, and a hexagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a triangle (pointing down), a circle, and a hexagon.

From this, we can see that the pattern alternates between a triangle (pointing down), a circle, and a hexagon.

Next, let's look at the columns:
