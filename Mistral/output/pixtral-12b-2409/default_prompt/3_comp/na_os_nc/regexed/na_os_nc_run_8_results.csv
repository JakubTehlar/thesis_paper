1. **First Column:**
   - Top: Circle
   - Middle: Pentagon
   - Bottom: Large Circle

2. **Second Column:**
   - Top: Pentagon
   - Middle: Triangle
   - Bottom: Large Circle

3. **Third Column:**

Now, let's look at the shapes in the empty box (marked with a question mark ?). The empty box is in the third column and the third row.

- Third Column: Pentagon, Pentagon, Large Circle
- Third Row: Large Circle, Triangle, Large Circle

From the analysis, we can see that the pattern involves alternating between shapes and sizes. Specifically, the third column alternates between Pentagon and Large Circle. The third row alternates between Large Circle and Triangle.

Given these patterns, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a Triangle, as it completes the alternating pattern in both the third column and the third row.

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - Top row: Hexagon, Small Pentagon, Square
   - Middle row: Small Pentagon, Large Pentagon, Diamond
   - Bottom row: Large Pentagon, Small Pentagon, Cross

2. **Identify the shapes in the options:**

   - B: Large Triangle
   - C: Small Square
   - D: Large Square
   - E: Large Diamond
   - F: Large Triangle
   - G: Small Triangle
   - H: Small Triangle

3. **Determine the pattern:**
   - The shapes in the grid transition from polygons to geometric figures. The shapes in the top row are all polygons (hexagon, pentagon, square).
   - The middle row transitions to more complex polygons (pentagon, pentagon, diamond).
   - The bottom row includes a cross, which is not a polygon.

4. **Identify the pattern in the options:**
   - The options include squares, triangles, and diamonds.
   - The pattern seems to involve shapes transitioning from squares to triangles.

5. **Match the pattern:**
   - The top row has a square, so the next shape should be a triangle.
   - The middle row has a diamond, which can be seen as a rotated square.
   - The bottom row has a cross, which does not fit the pattern.

Given this analysis, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a triangle, as it follows the pattern of transitioning from squares to triangles.

1. **Top Row**: Hexagon, Circle, Hexagon
2. **Middle Row**: Hexagon, Hexagon, Circle
3. **Bottom Row**: Circle, Hexagon, Hexagon

Next, we need to look at the shapes in the columns:

1. **First Column**: Circle, Hexagon, Circle
2. **Second Column**: Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon
3. **Third Column**: Hexagon, Circle, Hexagon

Now, let's examine the rows and columns for any repeating patterns:

From this analysis, we can see that the pattern alternates between shapes. Specifically, the shapes in the first and third rows follow a pattern of alternating between Hexagon and Circle. The second row follows a pattern of alternating between Hexagon and Circle as well.

Given the empty box is in the third row and second column, we need to determine the correct shape for this position. The pattern in the third row is Hexagon, Circle, Hexagon. Since the third row follows this pattern, the shape in the second column should be a Hexagon.

Therefore, the correct answer is a Hexagon.

2. Middle row: Pentagon with a diamond, hexagon with a square, circle with an inverted triangle.
3. Bottom row: Pentagon with a circle, triangle with a diamond, diamond with a pentagon, cross.

To find the pattern, we need to look at the shapes and their positions:

- The shapes in the first column are a pentagon with a square, a pentagon with a diamond, and a pentagon with a circle.
- The shapes in the second column are a hexagon with an inverted triangle, a hexagon with a square, and a triangle with a diamond.
- The shapes in the third column are a circle with a pentagon, a circle with an inverted triangle, and a cross.

The pattern might involve the type of shape or the filling inside the shape. Let's consider the shapes and their fillings:

- The first row has a pentagon with a square, a hexagon with an inverted triangle, and a circle with a pentagon.
- The second row has a pentagon with a diamond, a hexagon with a square, and a circle with an inverted triangle.
- The third row has a pentagon with a circle, a triangle with a diamond, and a cross.

The pattern could be based on the type of shape and the filling inside the shape. The shapes in the first column have a pentagon with different fillings (square, diamond, circle). The second column has a hexagon with different fillings (inverted triangle, square, diamond). The third column has a circle with different fillings (pentagon, inverted triangle, cross).

Given this analysis, the correct answer should be a pentagon with a circle, as it fits the pattern of the first column.
