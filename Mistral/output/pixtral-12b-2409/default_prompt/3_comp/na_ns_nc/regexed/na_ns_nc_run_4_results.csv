1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a pentagon.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a pentagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a pentagon.

2. **Second Column**: The shapes are a hexagon, a hexagon, and a hexagon.
3. **Third Column**: The shapes are a pentagon, a pentagon, and a triangle.

Now, let's look at the shapes in the bottom row:
- The first shape is a circle.
- The second shape is a hexagon.
- The third shape is a pentagon.

Given the pattern, the empty box in the bottom row should follow the sequence of shapes in the top and middle rows. The sequence of shapes in the top and middle rows is a circle, a hexagon, and a pentagon. Therefore, the shape that should be in the empty box in the bottom row should be a pentagon.

First, let's identify the shapes in each row and column:
- Row 1: Circle, Square, Pentagon
- Row 2: Pentagon, Circle, Square
- Row 3: Square, Pentagon, Circle

Columns:
- Column 1: Circle, Pentagon, Square
- Column 2: Square, Circle, Pentagon
- Column 3: Pentagon, Square, Circle

Now, let's look at the options A to F:
- A: Circle
- B: Square
- C: Pentagon
- D: Pentagon
- E: Circle
- F: Square

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern that the shapes follow. One possible pattern could be the alternation of shapes in a specific sequence.

Let's analyze the sequence:
- Row 1: Circle, Square, Pentagon
- Row 2: Pentagon, Circle, Square
- Row 3: Square, Pentagon, Circle

This pattern alternates the shapes in a specific order. To fill the empty space, we need to follow this sequence.

The empty space is in the third column and second row. Following the pattern:
- Second row: Pentagon, Circle, Square
- Third column: Square, Pentagon, Circle

The shape in the second row and third column should be a Circle.
