1. **First Row:**
   - Circle with square inside
   - Pentagon with circle inside
   - Triangle with hexagon inside

2. **Second Row:**
   - Circle with dot inside
   - Pentagon with filled dot inside
   - Triangle with filled dot inside

3. **Third Row:**
   - Circle with diamond inside
   - Pentagon with filled diamond inside
   - Cross mark

4. **Options:**
   - A: Triangle with filled triangle inside
   - B: Triangle with small triangle inside
   - C: Triangle with small filled dot inside
   - D: Triangle with filled hexagon inside
   - E: Triangle with small triangle inside
   - F: Triangle with hexagon inside

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the transformation pattern from the first row to the second row and then to the third row.

- From the first row to the second row:
  - Circle with square inside → Circle with dot inside
  - Pentagon with circle inside → Pentagon with filled dot inside
  - Triangle with hexagon inside → Triangle with filled dot inside

- From the second row to the third row:
  - Circle with dot inside → Circle with diamond inside
  - Pentagon with filled dot inside → Pentagon with filled diamond inside
  - Triangle with filled dot inside → Cross mark

The pattern involves changing the shape inside the circle, pentagon, and triangle from one type of shape to another, and then to a different type of shape in the third row.

Given this pattern, the correct choice should be a triangle with a shape inside that follows the pattern observed in the first two rows.

- Option A: Triangle with filled triangle inside (does not follow the pattern)
- Option B: Triangle with small triangle inside (does not follow the pattern)
- Option C: Triangle with small filled dot inside (does not follow the pattern)
- Option D: Triangle with filled hexagon inside (does not follow the pattern)
- Option E: Triangle with small triangle inside (does not follow the pattern)
- Option F: Triangle with hexagon inside (does not follow the pattern)

None of the options perfectly follow the observed pattern. However, the closest option that fits the transformation pattern is:

We can observe the following patterns:

- The shapes alternate between triangles, squares, and hexagons horizontally.
- The shapes alternate between squares and hexagons vertically.

Given these observations, the pattern for the missing shape in the bottom row should follow the sequence of the top row. Since the top row has a hexagon in the third position, the bottom row should also have a hexagon in the third position.
