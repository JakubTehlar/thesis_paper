3,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_nc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9997_val.png,E,T,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the 3x3 grid. The shapes in the grid are arranged in such a way that there is a consistent transformation or relationship between the shapes in adjacent cells.

First, let's examine the shapes in the grid:
- Top row: Circle, Circle, Hexagon
- Middle row: Circle, Hexagon, Pentagon
- Bottom row: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon

Next, let's look at the shapes in the columns:
- First column: Diamond, Circle, Pentagon
- Second column: Triangle, Hexagon, Circle
- Third column: Triangle, Pentagon, Triangle

Now, let's analyze the transformations:
1. From the first column to the second column:
   - Diamond to Triangle
   - Circle to Hexagon
   - Pentagon to Pentagon

2. From the second column to the third column:
   - Triangle to Triangle
   - Hexagon to Circle
   - Circle to Pentagon

3. From the third column to the first column:
   - Triangle to Diamond
   - Pentagon to Pentagon
   - Pentagon to Pentagon

The transformations involve changing the shape type while maintaining a consistent pattern. Specifically, the shapes in the first column are transformed into the shapes in the second column, and the shapes in the second column are transformed into the shapes in the third column.

Given this pattern, the missing shape in the empty box should be a Triangle, as it follows the transformation pattern observed in the grid.
