1. **Identify the Shapes and Their Arrangement**:
   - The grid contains various shapes: circles, pentagons, triangles, and hexagons.
   - The shapes vary in size and orientation.

2. **Analyze the Pattern**:
   - The shapes in the grid are arranged in a specific sequence.
   - We need to determine the rule governing the transition from one shape to the next.

3. **Examine Each Row**:
   - **First Row**: Circle, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, Triangle, Pentagon, Hexagon, Triangle.
   - **Second Row**: Pentagon, Circle, Hexagon, Circle, Triangle, Pentagon, Hexagon, Triangle.
   - **Third Row**: Circle, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, Triangle, Pentagon, Hexagon, Triangle.

4. **Identify the Pattern**:
   - The shapes alternate between different types and sizes.
   - The pattern seems to involve a sequence of shapes that repeat.

5. **Determine the Missing Shape**:
   - The missing shape is in the third row, third column.
   - We need to find the shape that fits the pattern.

6. **Check the Options**:
   - **A**: Pentagon
   - **B**: Pentagon
   - **C**: Pentagon
   - **D**: Pentagon
   - **E**: Pentagon
   - **F**: Pentagon

1. **Top Row**: 
   - Box 1: Circle
   - Box 2: Pentagon
   - Box 3: Large Circle

2. **Middle Row**: 
   - Box 1: Circle
   - Box 2: Pentagon
   - Box 3: Large Circle

3. **Bottom Row**: 
   - Box 1: Circle
   - Box 2: Pentagon
   - Box 3: Large Circle

From this, we can see that the pattern alternates between a Circle, Pentagon, and Large Circle in each row.

Next, let's look at the options provided (A to F):

- **A**: Circle
- **B**: Circle
- **C**: Large Circle
- **D**: Large Circle
- **E**: Pentagon
- **F**: Pentagon

Given the pattern, the empty box (marked with a question mark) should be filled with a shape that follows the sequence of Circle, Pentagon, Large Circle.

Since the top row ends with a Large Circle, the next shape in the sequence would be a Circle.

Therefore, the correct answer is a Circle, which corresponds to option A.

Each box contains a shape with specific characteristics, such as the number of sides, the number of dots inside, and the arrangement of the dots.

1. **Shape Analysis**:
   - The shapes in the grid include pentagons, circles, and triangles.
   - The number of dots inside the shapes varies from zero to three.
   - The arrangement of the dots within the shapes is also different.

2. **Identifying the Pattern**:
   - The pattern might be based on the number of dots, the type of shape, or the position of the dots within the shapes.
   - Observing the shapes in the grid, we see that the shapes alternate between pentagons and circles in the first two rows, and the third row has a mix of shapes.

3. **Filling the Empty Box**:
   - The empty box is in the third row and second column.
   - We need to find a shape that fits the pattern of the third row.

4. **Matching the Pattern**:
   - In the third row, the shapes are a pentagon with two dots, a triangle with one dot, and an 'X'.
   - The pattern seems to involve alternating between pentagons and triangles with varying numbers of dots.

5. **Choosing the Correct Shape**:
   - From the options A to F, we need to find a shape that fits the pattern of the third row.
   - Option E is a triangle with one dot, which matches the pattern of the third row.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- **C**: Hexagon with one circle.
- **D**: Hexagon with one circle.
- **E**: Hexagon with three circles.
- **F**: Hexagon with three circles.
- **G**: Hexagon with three circles.
- **H**: Hexagon with three circles.

The pattern involves the number of circles inside the hexagons. The sequence of the number of circles in the hexagons is:
- Top Middle: 3 circles

### Top Row:
1. Diamond (black)
2. Diamond (black)
3. Diamond (gray)

### Middle Row:
1. Inverted triangle (white)
2. Square (white)
3. Circle (white)

### Bottom Row:
1. Circle (black)
2. Square (black)
3. Inverted triangle (black)

### Analysis:
1. **Shape Transformation:**
   - The shapes change from black to white from the top row to the bottom row.
   - The shapes change from filled to empty from the top row to the bottom row.

2. **Shape Rotation:**
   - The shapes rotate 90 degrees clockwise from the top row to the bottom row.

### Applying the Pattern:
- The top row has filled shapes.
- The middle row has empty shapes.
- The bottom row has filled shapes that are rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

Given this pattern, the empty box in the middle row should be filled with a shape that is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the shape in the top row directly above it.

### Applying the Pattern to the Empty Box:
- The empty box is in the middle row, third column.
- The shape directly above it in the top row is a gray diamond.
- Rotating a gray diamond 90 degrees clockwise results in a gray square.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is a gray square.

Let's break down the patterns:

1. **Shape Pattern:**
   - First row: Triangle, Hexagon, Circle
   - Second row: Circle, Hexagon, Triangle
   - Third row: Triangle, Circle, Hexagon

   The pattern alternates between the shapes in each row.

2. **Color Pattern:**
   - First row: Black, Gray, White
   - Second row: Gray, White, Black
   - Third row: Black, White, Gray

   The color pattern alternates between black, gray, and white in each row.

3. **Combined Pattern:**
   - First row: Black Triangle, Gray Hexagon, White Circle
   - Second row: Gray Circle, White Hexagon, Black Triangle
   - Third row: Black Triangle, White Circle, Gray Hexagon

   The combined pattern alternates between the shapes and their colors.

To fill the empty box in the third column of the second row, we need to follow the combined pattern:

- The shape in the third column of the second row should be a Circle.
- The color in the third column of the second row should be White.

Therefore, the correct shape to fill the empty box is a White Circle.
