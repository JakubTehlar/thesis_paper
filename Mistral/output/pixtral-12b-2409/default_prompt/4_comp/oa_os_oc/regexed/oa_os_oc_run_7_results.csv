### Row 1:
- Shape 1: Circle
- Shape 2: Pentagon
- Shape 3: Triangle

### Row 2:
- Shape 1: Square
- Shape 2: Pentagon
- Shape 3: Triangle

### Row 3:

### Observations:
1. The first row alternates between different shapes (Circle, Pentagon, Triangle).
2. The second row alternates between different shapes (Square, Pentagon, Triangle).
3. The third row alternates between different shapes (Circle, Pentagon, Diamond).
4. The first column alternates between different shapes (Circle, Square, Circle).

6. The third column alternates between different shapes (Triangle, Triangle, Diamond).
7. The first diagonal alternates between different shapes (Circle, Pentagon, Diamond).
8. The second diagonal alternates between different shapes (Triangle, Pentagon, Circle).

Given these observations, we need to determine which shape fits the pattern for the empty box in the third row, second column.

",False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes and their positions in the grid:

1. **First Row:**
   - Shape 1: Diamond with three circles inside.
   - Shape 2: Diamond with two circles inside.
   - Shape 3: Diamond with one circle inside.

2. **Second Row:**

",False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the shapes within the 3x3 grid. The shapes are arranged in a way that suggests a relationship between their positions and their forms.

First, let's examine the shapes in the top row:
- The shapes are arranged as follows: Hexagon, Hexagon, Square, Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon.

Next, let's look at the middle row:
- The shapes are arranged as follows: Hexagon, Hexagon, Square, Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon.

Finally, the bottom row:
- The shapes are arranged as follows: Hexagon, Hexagon, Square, Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon.

From this, we can observe that the pattern alternates between hexagons and squares. Specifically, the pattern seems to be:

",False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: diamond, large circle, triangle
2. Middle row: small circle, large triangle, square
3. Bottom row: large triangle, small diamond, cross

Next, we examine the options provided:

A. Small circle
B. Large hexagon
C. Small hexagon
D. Empty circle
E. Large hexagon (shaded)
F. Large circle

We need to determine the relationship between the shapes in the grid. One possible pattern could be the size of the shapes (small vs. large) or the type of shape (circle, triangle, square, diamond, cross).

Let's analyze the options:

- A (Small circle): This matches the small circle in the middle row, second column.
- B (Large hexagon): This does not match any shape in the grid.
- C (Small hexagon): This does not match any shape in the grid.
- D (Empty circle): This does not match any shape in the grid.
- E (Large hexagon, shaded): This does not match any shape in the grid.
- F (Large circle): This matches the large circle in the top row, second column.

Given the pattern of size and type, the correct answer should be the shape that fits the pattern of large shapes in the grid.

",False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the patterns in the grid. Let's break down the rows and columns to identify the relationships between the shapes.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Row:**
   - Shapes: Circle, Pentagon, Hexagon
   - Colors: Dark, Light, Dark
   - Sizes: Small, Medium, Large

2. **Second Row:**
   - Shapes: Square, Pentagon, Triangle

### Identifying the Pattern:
- **Shape Pattern:** The shapes alternate between different types (Circle, Pentagon, Hexagon, etc.).
- **Color Pattern:** The colors alternate between Dark and Light.
- **Size Pattern:** The sizes alternate between Small, Medium, and Large.

Given these patterns, we need to determine which shape fits in the empty box while maintaining the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The empty box is in the third row and third column. The shape in the third row and third column should follow the pattern observed in the first and second rows.

- **Shape:** The third column has a Hexagon in the first row and a Circle in the second row. The pattern alternates between these shapes.
- **Color:** The third column has Dark in the first row and Dark in the second row. The pattern is consistent with Dark.
- **Size:** The third column has Large in the first row and Small in the second row. The pattern alternates between Large and Small.

Therefore, the shape that fits the empty box should be a Circle (following the alternating pattern), Dark in color, and Small in size.

2. **Second Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a large triangle, a hexagon, a large triangle, a hexagon, and a large triangle.
3. **Third Row**: The shapes are a small square, a large circle, a small square, a large circle, a small square, and a large circle.

Next, let's look at the columns:

1. **First Column**: The shapes are a small square, a hexagon, and a small square.
2. **Second Column**: The shapes are a large diamond, a large triangle, and a large circle.
3. **Third Column**: The shapes are a small square, a hexagon, and a small square.
4. **Fourth Column**: The shapes are a large diamond, a large triangle, and a large circle.
5. **Fifth Column**: The shapes are a small square, a hexagon, and a small square.
6. **Sixth Column**: The shapes are a large diamond, a large triangle, and a large circle.

8. **Eighth Column**: The shapes are a large diamond, a large triangle, and a large circle.
9. **Ninth Column**: The shapes are a small square, a hexagon, and a small square.

Now, let's identify the pattern in the empty box (marked with a question mark ?). The empty box is in the third row and the ninth column. The shapes in the third row are small squares, large circles, and small squares. The shapes in the ninth column are small squares, hexagons, and small squares.

To determine the correct shape, we need to look at the adjacent shapes in the third row and the ninth column. The adjacent shapes in the third row are small squares and large circles. The adjacent shapes in the ninth column are small squares and hexagons.

Given these patterns, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a small square, as it is the only shape that consistently appears in both the third row and the ninth column.

Now, let's look at the options provided:

- A: Gray diamond

- D: Gray diamond
- E: White triangle
- F: White diamond

The pattern in the grid alternates between shapes and colors. The first row has white triangles, the second row has gray squares, and the third row has gray shapes (two diamonds and one cross).

To determine the pattern, we need to consider the transition from the second row to the third row. The second row has gray squares, and the third row has gray shapes. The transition from squares to diamonds and a cross suggests a change in shape but maintaining the gray color.

Given this, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a gray shape that fits the pattern of the third row. The options are:

- A: Gray diamond
- B: Gray triangle
- D: Gray diamond
- F: White diamond

Since the third row has two diamonds, we should choose a gray diamond to maintain the pattern.

2. **Second Row**: Three squares with a circle inside them.
3. **Third Row**: Three hexagons with a circle inside them, followed by a hexagon with an 'X'.

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the shapes and their internal elements:
- The first row has circles with a square inside.
- The second row has squares with a circle inside.
- The third row has hexagons with a circle inside, followed by a hexagon with an 'X'.

The pattern seems to alternate between shapes and their internal elements. Specifically, the internal elements are a square, a circle, and a circle.

Given this pattern, the next shape should follow the sequence of shapes and their internal elements. The sequence is:
- Circle with a square inside
- Square with a circle inside
- Hexagon with a circle inside

The empty box is in the third row and third column, which should follow the pattern of the third row. The third row has hexagons with a circle inside, so the correct shape should be a hexagon with a circle inside.
