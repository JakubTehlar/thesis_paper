2. **Second Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a diamond, and a square.
3. **Third Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a diamond, and a square.

**Pattern Analysis**:
- The shapes alternate between hexagons and diamonds, with a square at the end.
- The first and second rows have the same pattern, while the third row follows the same pattern but is shifted one position to the right.

**Column Analysis**:
- **First Column**: Hexagon, triangle, hexagon.
- **Second Column**: Diamond, circle, diamond.
- **Third Column**: Square, circle, square.

**Pattern Analysis**:
- The first column alternates between hexagons and triangles.
- The second column alternates between diamonds and circles.

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - Top row: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle
   - Middle row: Square, Pentagon, Triangle
   - Bottom row: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle

2. **Identify the patterns:**
   - The shapes alternate between different forms (circle, square, pentagon, triangle).
