2,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_os_nc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9999_test.png,B,B,True,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the 3x3 grid. Each row and column contains a sequence of shapes that follow a specific rule. Let's break it down:

1. **First Row**: The shapes are a circle, triangle, and hexagon.
2. **Second Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, circle, and triangle.
3. **Third Row**: The shapes are a triangle, hexagon, and circle.

To find the pattern, we need to look at the transformations from one shape to another. The shapes are changing in a systematic way.

### Observations:
- The shapes alternate between circles, triangles, and hexagons.
- The orientation of the shapes (upright or inverted) also changes.

### Pattern Analysis:
- **First Column**: Circle, Hexagon, Triangle
- **Second Column**: Triangle, Circle, Hexagon
- **Third Column**: Hexagon, Triangle, Circle

### Transformation Rules:
- From Circle to Triangle: The circle becomes an inverted triangle.
- From Triangle to Hexagon: The triangle becomes an upright hexagon.
- From Hexagon to Circle: The hexagon becomes an upright circle.

### Applying the Rules:
- **First Row to Second Row**:
  - Circle (First Row) -> Triangle (Second Row)
  - Triangle (First Row) -> Hexagon (Second Row)
  - Hexagon (First Row) -> Circle (Second Row)

- **Second Row to Third Row**:
  - Triangle (Second Row) -> Hexagon (Third Row)
  - Hexagon (Second Row) -> Circle (Third Row)
