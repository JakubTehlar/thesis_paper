0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_os_nc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9961_train.png,D,E,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the patterns in the grid. The grid consists of shapes arranged in a 3x3 matrix, with one empty box marked by a question mark (?).

First, let's identify the shapes in each row and column:
- Row 1: Circle, Square, Pentagon
- Row 2: Diamond, Pentagon, Pentagon
- Row 3: Pentagon, Circle, Cross

- Column 1: Dark Circle, Dark Diamond, Pentagon
- Column 2: Dark Circle, Dark Diamond, Dark Circle
- Column 3: Pentagon, Dark Diamond, Dark Circle

Next, let's analyze the patterns:
1. **Shape Transformation**: The shapes in the grid transform from one shape to another. For instance, in Column 1, the shapes change from a Dark Circle to a Dark Diamond to a Pentagon.
2. **Color Transformation**: The colors also change. For example, in Column 2, the shapes change from a Dark Circle to a Dark Diamond to another Dark Circle.
3. **Shape and Color Consistency**: In Column 3, the shapes change from a Pentagon to a Dark Diamond to a Dark Circle, and the colors change accordingly.

Given these observations, we need to determine which shape fits in the empty box to maintain the pattern. The empty box is in the third column and second row. The shape above it is a Dark Diamond, and the shape to the left is a Pentagon.

Following the pattern:
- The shape above is a Dark Diamond.
- The shape to the left is a Pentagon.

Thus, the shape that fits the pattern should be a Dark Diamond.

The correct answer is: **E**"
1,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_os_nc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9972_train.png,C,C,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern of the shapes in the 3x3 grid. The shapes vary in form (circle, square, hexagon, etc.) and shading (black, gray, white).

1. **Identify the Pattern**: Look at the shapes in the grid and determine if there is a consistent pattern in their arrangement. The shapes are arranged in a specific order, and the pattern might be based on their form, shading, or both.

2. **Analyze the Shapes**: Examine the shapes in the top row, middle row, and bottom row. Notice the sequence and repetition of shapes.

3. **Determine the Rule**: Determine the rule governing the sequence of shapes. This could be a rotation, reflection, or a specific order of shapes.

4. **Apply the Rule**: Apply the identified rule to the empty box to find the correct shape.

Upon examining the image, it appears that the pattern involves alternating shapes and their shading. The sequence of shapes in the top row is: circle, hexagon, square. The middle row follows a similar pattern but with different shapes and shading. The bottom row continues this pattern.

Given the sequence and the alternating nature of the shapes, the correct shape to fill the empty box should follow the pattern observed in the grid.

The correct answer is: **C**."
2,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_os_nc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9999_test.png,B,B,True,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the patterns in the grid. The grid consists of a 3x3 arrangement with different shapes in each box. The shapes include circles, triangles, and hexagons, each in various orientations and shades.

Let's break down the patterns:

1. **Rows:**
   - First row: Circle, Triangle, Hexagon
   - Second row: Hexagon, Circle, Triangle
   - Third row: Triangle, Hexagon, Circle

2. **Columns:**
   - First column: Circle, Hexagon, Triangle

   - Top-right to bottom-left: Hexagon, Circle, Triangle

4. **Shapes:**
   - Circle: Different sizes and shades
   - Triangle: Different orientations and shades
   - Hexagon: Different shades

Given these patterns, we need to determine which shape fits the empty box. The empty box is in the third column and second row. The shape in the third column and first row is a triangle, and the shape in the third column and third row is a circle. The shape in the second row and third column is a hexagon.

To complete the pattern, we need to determine which shape would logically fit in the empty box. Observing the patterns, the shapes alternate between rows and columns. The second row and third column currently have a hexagon. The pattern suggests that the next shape should be a triangle, as the first and third rows have triangles in the third column.

Therefore, the correct answer is a triangle.
