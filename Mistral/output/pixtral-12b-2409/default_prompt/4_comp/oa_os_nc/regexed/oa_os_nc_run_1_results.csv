0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_os_nc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9961_train.png,D,B,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each row and column.

### Top Row:
- Shapes: Hexagon, Circle, Square, Circle, Pentagon, Circle
- Pattern: Alternating shapes between polygons and circles.

### Middle Row:
- Shapes: Diamond, Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon, Hexagon, Pentagon
- Pattern: Repeating pentagons with a single hexagon in the middle.

### Bottom Row:
- Shapes: Circle, Pentagon, Circle, Pentagon, Pentagon, Diamond, Circle, Diamond, Circle
- Pattern: Alternating between circles and polygons (pentagons and diamonds).

### Columns:
- Column 1: Circle, Pentagon, Circle
- Column 2: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
- Column 3: Diamond, Diamond, Circle
- Column 4: Circle, Circle, Diamond
- Column 5: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
- Column 6: Diamond, Diamond, Circle

### Analysis:
- The first column alternates between circles and pentagons.
- The second column has only pentagons.
- The third column alternates between diamonds and circles.
- The fourth column alternates between circles and diamonds.
- The fifth column has only pentagons.
- The sixth column alternates between diamonds and circles.

### Conclusion:
To fill the empty box in the grid, we need to follow the pattern in the columns. The empty box is in the third column, which alternates between diamonds and circles. The previous shape in the column is a diamond, so the next shape should be a circle.

### The correct answer is: B

1,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_os_nc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9972_train.png,C,B,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern of the shapes in the grid. The shapes are arranged in a 3x3 grid, with one empty box marked by a question mark (?). The goal is to identify the correct shape that completes the pattern.

First, let's examine the shapes in the grid:
- Top row: Hexagon, Circle, Hexagon
- Middle row: Circle, Square, Triangle
- Bottom row: Hexagon, Circle, Square

Next, let's look at the options provided (A to F):
- A: Circle, Square, Triangle
- B: Hexagon, Circle, Square
- C: Circle, Hexagon, Square
- D: Hexagon, Circle, Triangle
- E: Circle, Square, Hexagon
- F: Hexagon, Square, Circle

To determine the correct pattern, we need to identify a consistent rule that applies to the arrangement of shapes in the grid. One possible approach is to look for a sequence or rotation of shapes.

Upon examining the options, we can see that the sequence of shapes in option B matches the sequence in the grid:
- Top row: Hexagon, Circle, Hexagon
- Middle row: Circle, Square, Triangle
- Bottom row: Hexagon, Circle, Square

Option B: Hexagon, Circle, Square matches the sequence in the grid.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
The correct answer is: B"
2,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_os_nc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9999_test.png,B,E,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each column and row:

1. **First Column:**
   - Top: Circle
   - Middle: Pentagon
   - Bottom: Inverted Triangle

2. **Second Column:**
   - Top: Pentagon
   - Middle: Circle
   - Bottom: Pentagon

3. **Third Column:**
   - Top: Pentagon
   - Middle: Pentagon
   - Bottom: Pentagon

4. **First Row:**
   - Left: Circle
   - Middle: Pentagon
   - Right: Pentagon

5. **Second Row:**
   - Left: Pentagon
   - Middle: Circle
   - Right: Pentagon

6. **Third Row:**
   - Left: Inverted Triangle
   - Middle: Pentagon
   - Right: Pentagon

Now, let's look at the shapes in the rows and columns:
- The first column has a mix of shapes: Circle, Pentagon, Inverted Triangle.
- The second column has a mix of shapes: Pentagon, Circle, Pentagon.
- The third column has all Pentagons.
- The first row has a mix of shapes: Circle, Pentagon, Pentagon.
- The second row has a mix of shapes: Pentagon, Circle, Pentagon.
- The third row has a mix of shapes: Inverted Triangle, Pentagon, Pentagon.

Given the pattern, it seems that the third column, which has all Pentagons, might be the key. The pattern could be that each row and column transitions to having more Pentagons.

To fill the empty box, we need to determine which shape will complete the pattern in the third column. Since the third column already has two Pentagons, the third shape should be a Pentagon to maintain the pattern.

Therefore, the correct answer is a Pentagon.

The correct answer is: E"

- B: Circle
- C: Large triangle pointing up
- D: Small triangle pointing up
- E: Circle
- F: Large diamond

To determine the correct answer, we need to find the shape that fits the pattern in the empty box. The pattern seems to involve alternating between different shapes without a clear visual transformation rule. However, we can observe that the shapes in the grid are diverse and do not follow a simple transformation rule.

Given the complexity and diversity of the shapes, it is challenging to determine a definitive pattern. Therefore, we need to rely on logical deduction and visual inspection to match the shapes.

Upon careful inspection, the empty box is in the bottom row, third column. The shapes in the bottom row are: small diamond, circle, and cross. The shape that would logically fit in the empty box, considering the diversity and lack of a clear transformation rule, is a circle.
