6,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_os_nc_center_single_RAVEN_9978_test.png,F,B,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. Top row: Triangle, Black Square, Dark Pentagon
2. Middle row: Dark Diamond, White Pentagon, Black Pentagon
3. Bottom row: Dark Diamond, Dark Pentagon, Cross

Now, let's examine the six options provided:

- A: White Pentagon
- B: Dark Pentagon
- C: Dark Triangle
- D: Dark Large Triangle
- E: White Triangle
- F: White Hexagon

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the shape transformations or relationships between the shapes in the grid. One possible pattern could be the transformation of shapes from one form to another, such as from a triangle to a pentagon or from a dark shape to a light shape.

Let's analyze the transformations:

- From the top row to the middle row:
  - Triangle to Dark Diamond
  - Black Square to White Pentagon
  - Dark Pentagon to Black Pentagon

- From the middle row to the bottom row:
  - Dark Diamond to Dark Diamond
  - White Pentagon to Dark Pentagon
  - Black Pentagon to Cross

Given these transformations, we can see that the pattern involves changing the shape and possibly the color. The empty box in the bottom row is currently a Cross. To find the correct shape, we need to determine the next transformation from a Cross.

Since there is no direct transformation from a Cross to another shape in the grid, we need to consider the pattern of changing shapes and colors. The Cross does not fit into the pattern of changing shapes, so we need to look at the previous shapes in the row to determine the correct transformation.

The previous shape in the middle row was a Black Pentagon, which transformed into a Dark Pentagon in the bottom row. Therefore, the correct transformation from a Cross would be to a Dark Pentagon.

The correct answer is: B

- D: Small triangle pointing up
- E: Circle
- F: Large triangle pointing up

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern. One possible pattern could be the type of shape (e.g., all circles, all triangles, etc.). Another pattern could be the size of the shapes (e.g., all large shapes, all small shapes, etc.).

Let's analyze the options:

- A: Large triangle pointing down
- B: Circle
- C: Large triangle pointing up
- D: Small triangle pointing up
- E: Circle
- F: Large triangle pointing up

Given the pattern in the grid, we can see that the shapes alternate between large and small shapes. The empty box is in the bottom row, which alternates between small shapes and circles. The previous box in the bottom row has a circle, so the next shape should be a small shape.

   - The middle row has diamonds with different inner shapes (triangle, square, circle).
   - The bottom row has diamonds with different inner shapes (triangle, square, circle).

4. **Determine the pattern for the empty box:**
   - The empty box is in the bottom row, which currently has diamonds with a triangle, square, and circle.
   - The pattern in the bottom row alternates between diamonds with different inner shapes.

5. **Match the pattern:**
   - The empty box is next to a diamond with a square (middle row) and a diamond with a circle (bottom row).
