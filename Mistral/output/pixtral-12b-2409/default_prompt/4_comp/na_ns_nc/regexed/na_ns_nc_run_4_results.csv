0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_ns_nc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9968_test.png,B,B,True,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the pattern in the 3x3 grid. The shapes in the grid are arranged in a way that follows a specific rule or sequence. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - Top row: Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon
   - Middle row: Square, Triangle, Hexagon
   - Bottom row: Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon

2. **Observe the pattern:**
   - The top row has three hexagons.
   - The middle row has a square, a triangle, and a hexagon.
   - The bottom row has two hexagons.

3. **Determine the rule:**
   - The pattern seems to involve shapes transitioning from one to another. Specifically, the middle row has a square and a triangle, which are different from the hexagons in the top and bottom rows.

4. **Analyze the options:**
   - A: Hexagon
   - B: Square
   - C: Triangle
   - D: Hexagon
   - E: Hexagon
   - F: Hexagon

5. **Identify the missing shape:**
   - The missing shape in the middle row is a square (B).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is: B"
1,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_ns_nc_up_center_single_down_center_single_RAVEN_9815_train.png,D,D,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the grid. Let's analyze the shapes row by row.

### Row 1:
- Top-left: Square (black)
- Top-middle: Square (white)
- Top-right: Square (black)

### Row 2:
- Middle-left: Diamond (gray)
- Middle-middle: Diamond (gray)
- Middle-right: Diamond (gray)

### Row 3:
- Bottom-left: Circle (gray)
- Bottom-middle: Circle (gray)
- Bottom-right: Circle (gray)

### Column 1:
- Leftmost column: Square (black), Diamond (gray), Circle (gray)

### Column 2:
- Middle column: Square (white), Diamond (gray), Circle (gray)

### Column 3:
- Rightmost column: Square (black), Diamond (gray), Circle (gray)

### Empty Box:

### Analysis:
1. **Shapes in the middle row (Row 2):**
   - Middle-left: Diamond (gray)
   - Middle-middle: Diamond (gray)
   - Middle-right: Diamond (gray)

2. **Shapes in the middle column (Column 2):**
   - Top-middle: Square (white)
   - Middle-middle: Diamond (gray)
   - Bottom-middle: Circle (gray)

### Pattern:
- The middle row and middle column both contain Diamonds (gray) in the middle position.
- The middle column has a sequence of Square (white), Diamond (gray), Circle (gray).

Given this pattern, the shape that fits the middle position in the middle column should be a Diamond (gray).

1. Top row: Triangle, Pentagon, Circle
2. Middle row: Pentagon, Circle, Triangle
3. Bottom row: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle

Next, let's look at the shapes inside each figure:
- Top row:
  - Triangle: Contains a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.
  - Pentagon: Contains two circles and a small triangle.
  - Circle: Contains a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.

- Middle row:
  - Pentagon: Contains a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.
  - Circle: Contains a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.
  - Triangle: Contains a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.

- Bottom row:
  - Circle: Contains a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.
  - Pentagon: Contains a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.
  - Triangle: Contains a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.

The pattern seems to involve the shapes containing a small triangle, circle, and pentagon in various orders and positions. The empty box is in the middle row, third column.

Now, let's examine the options:
- A: Circle with a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.
- B: Pentagon with a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.
- C: Circle with a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.
- D: Pentagon with a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.
- E: Circle with a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.
- F: Pentagon with a small triangle, circle, and pentagon.

Given the pattern, the correct answer should be a shape that fits the sequence of containing a small triangle, circle, and pentagon. Options A, C, and E all fit this pattern.

Since the empty box is in the middle row, third column, and the pattern alternates between shapes, the correct answer should be consistent with the sequence. The middle row has a Circle and a Pentagon, so the third column should logically follow the pattern of the previous shapes.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
The correct answer is: C.

4,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_ns_nc_in_center_single_out_center_single_RAVEN_9806_val.png,H,E,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. Top row: Triangle with a small triangle inside, small triangle inside, and large triangle inside.
2. Middle row: Pentagon with a small hexagon inside, small hexagon inside, and large hexagon inside.
3. Bottom row: Triangle with a small circle inside, small circle inside, and an 'X' mark.

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the shapes and their transformations from one box to the next:

- The first column has a triangle with a small triangle inside, a pentagon with a small hexagon inside, and a triangle with a small circle inside.
- The second column has a triangle with a small triangle inside, a pentagon with a small hexagon inside, and a triangle with a small circle inside.
- The third column has a triangle with a large triangle inside, a pentagon with a large hexagon inside, and an 'X' mark.

Observing the pattern, it appears that the shapes are changing in size and type from one column to the next. The shapes in the third column are larger versions of the shapes in the first column.

Given this pattern, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a larger version of the shape in the first column of the same row.

For the empty box in the third column of the middle row, the corresponding shape in the first column is a pentagon with a small hexagon inside. Therefore, the correct shape should be a pentagon with a large hexagon inside.

3. Bottom row: Light square, light circle, light triangle

Now, let's look at the options:

- A: Dark hexagon
- B: Dark small square
- C: Light small square
- D: Dark rectangle
- E: Light hexagon
- F: Dark small hexagon

To determine the pattern, we need to consider the shape types and their colors. The shapes in the grid include triangles, squares, and circles. The pattern alternates between dark and light colors.

Given this, the pattern seems to alternate between dark and light shapes. The empty box is in the middle row, which currently has light shapes. Therefore, the next shape should be dark.

Among the options, the dark shapes are A, B, D, and F. Since the grid already has a dark circle and a dark square, the next dark shape should be a dark triangle to maintain the pattern of different shapes.

2. Middle row: Hexagon, large hexagon, small hexagon
3. Bottom row: Pentagon, large pentagon, small pentagon

The shapes in the grid are squares, hexagons, and pentagons. The pattern seems to involve different types of polygons and their sizes.

Next, let's look at the options provided (A to F):

- A: Small diamond
- B: Large diamond
- C: Large diamond
- D: Large pentagon
- E: Small pentagon
- F: Small pentagon

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify which shape completes the pattern in the empty box. The pattern involves different types of polygons and their sizes. The empty box is in the middle row, which currently has a hexagon, a large hexagon, and a small hexagon.

Given the pattern, the middle row should have a shape that fits the progression of hexagons. The correct answer should be a shape that continues the pattern of varying sizes of hexagons.
