0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_oc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9869_test.png,D,E,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.

Next, let's look at the shapes in the columns:

1. **First Column**: The shapes are a triangle, a triangle, and a triangle.
2. **Second Column**: The shapes are a square, a square, and a square.
3. **Third Column**: The shapes are a pentagon, a pentagon, and a pentagon.

Now, let's examine the rows and columns for any consistent pattern:

- **Second Row**: Triangle, Square, Pentagon
- **Third Row**: Triangle, Square, Pentagon

- **First Column**: Triangle, Triangle, Triangle
- **Second Column**: Square, Square, Square
- **Third Column**: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon

From this analysis, we can see that each row and each column contains the same type of shape repeated. Therefore, the pattern is that each row and each column must contain the same type of shape.

Given the empty box is in the third column, it must be filled with a pentagon to maintain the pattern.
