0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_oc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9869_test.png,D,E,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the patterns in the shapes and their arrangement within the grid. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Shapes**: The shapes in the grid include triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons. These shapes vary in orientation and shading.

2. **Analyze the Grid**: The grid has an empty box in the middle, marked with a question mark (?). The shapes around it need to be examined for any consistent pattern.

3. **Shape Rotation and Shading**: Notice that some shapes are rotated versions of others, and some are shaded differently. This suggests that rotation and shading might be part of the pattern.

4. **Horizontal and Vertical Patterns**: Look at the shapes in each row and column. For example:
   - Top row: The shapes are a mix of triangles, squares, and pentagons.
   - Middle row: The shapes include a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.
   - Bottom row: The shapes include a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.

5. **Identify the Missing Shape**: The missing shape must fit the pattern of the surrounding shapes. It should be a shape that can be derived by rotating or shading one of the existing shapes.

6. **Compare with Options**: Compare the shapes in the grid with the options provided (A to F). Look for a shape that can be derived from the existing ones by rotation or shading.

After analyzing the patterns, the correct shape that fits the empty box is:

**The correct answer is: E**"
1,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_oc_in_distribute_four_out_center_single_RAVEN_9994_train.png,G,E,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the patterns in the shapes and their arrangements within the boxes. Let's break down the elements:

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a diamond, a triangle, and two pentagons.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a square, and a triangle.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a hexagon, a pentagon, and a triangle.

Next, we need to identify the pattern that connects these shapes. One possible approach is to look at the number of sides or the type of shapes.

- **Shape Types**: The shapes include diamonds, triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons.
- **Arrangement**: The shapes are arranged in a specific sequence within each box.

Let's examine the options A to F:

- **Option A**: Contains a mix of shapes, including a square and a triangle.
- **Option B**: Contains a mix of shapes, including a square and a triangle.
- **Option C**: Contains a mix of shapes, including a square and a triangle.
- **Option D**: Contains a mix of shapes, including a square and a triangle.
- **Option E**: Contains a mix of shapes, including a square and a triangle.
- **Option F**: Contains a mix of shapes, including a square and a triangle.

Given the complexity and the need to match the pattern, we need to ensure the correct shape is placed in the empty box. By analyzing the sequence and the types of shapes, we can determine the correct answer.

The correct answer is: **E**."
2,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_oc_center_single_RAVEN_9946_val.png,B,D,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: Three empty triangles.
2. Middle row: Three filled squares.
3. Bottom row: Two filled diamonds, one empty box with a question mark, and one filled cross.

The pattern seems to involve alternating between different types of shapes and their fillings. Let's examine the options (A to F) to find the correct shape:

- **A**: A pentagon.
- **B**: A small diamond.
- **C**: A small diamond.
- **D**: A large diamond.
- **E**: A small pentagon.
- **F**: A large diamond.
- **G**: A pentagon.
- **H**: A small pentagon.

Given the pattern of alternating shapes and fillings, the correct choice should be a shape that fits the sequence of the pattern. The sequence in the bottom row is: filled diamond, empty box, filled cross. The next shape should logically be a filled diamond to maintain the pattern of alternating filled shapes.

Therefore, the correct answer is a large diamond, which is option **D**.

The correct answer is: D."

4,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_oc_in_distribute_four_out_center_single_RAVEN_9992_train.png,D,C,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the shapes within the 3x3 grid. Each shape contains specific symbols arranged in a particular manner. Let's break down the patterns:

1. **Top Row:**
   - First box: Three squares in a triangle formation.
   - Second box: Three circles in a triangle formation.
   - Third box: Three pentagons in a triangle formation.

2. **Middle Row:**
   - First box: Three squares in a triangle formation.
   - Second box: Three circles in a triangle formation.
   - Third box: Three pentagons in a triangle formation.

3. **Bottom Row:**
   - First box: Three squares in a triangle formation.
   - Second box: Three circles in a triangle formation.
   - Third box: Three pentagons in a triangle formation.

4. **Symbols:**
   - Squares are consistently used in the first column.
   - Circles are consistently used in the second column.
   - Pentagons are consistently used in the third column.

Given the consistent use of symbols in each column, the pattern seems to be based on the type of shape rather than the arrangement of symbols within the shapes. Therefore, the correct answer should match the shape type in the column where the empty box is located.

Since the empty box is in the third column, the correct shape should be the one that uses pentagons.

The correct answer is: **C**

**Final Answer:** The correct answer is: C"
5,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_oc_up_center_single_down_center_single_RAVEN_9994_train.png,H,B,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes row by row:

1. **First Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a pentagon, and a hexagon.
2. **Second Row**: The shapes are a pentagon, a hexagon, and a circle.
3. **Third Row**: The shapes are a square, a hexagon, and a pentagon.

Next, let's look at the columns:

Finally, let's examine the diagonals:

1. **First Diagonal**: The shapes are a hexagon, a hexagon, and a square.
2. **Second Diagonal**: The shapes are a pentagon, a circle, and a pentagon.

From this analysis, we can see that the pattern involves alternating between hexagons and pentagons. The empty box is in the third column and second row. The shape above it is a hexagon, and the shape to its left is a hexagon. Therefore, the shape that should fill the empty box should be a pentagon.

The correct answer is: **B**."

2. **Second Row**:
   - Shape 1: Hexagon with a small pentagon inside.
   - Shape 2: Hexagon with a larger pentagon inside.
   - Shape 3: Hexagon with an even larger pentagon inside.

   The pattern here is an increasing size of the pentagon inside the hexagon.

3. **Third Row**:
   - Shape 1: Pentagon with a small triangle inside.
   - Shape 2: Pentagon with a larger triangle inside.
   - Shape 3: Cross mark.

   The pattern here is an increasing size of the triangle inside the pentagon.

Now, let's look at the options A to F:

- **A**: Pentagon with a small triangle inside.
- **B**: Pentagon with a larger triangle inside.
- **C**: Pentagon with an even larger triangle inside.
- **D**: Pentagon with an even larger triangle inside.
- **E**: Pentagon with an even larger triangle inside.
- **F**: Pentagon with an even larger triangle inside.

The pattern in the third row of the grid shows an increasing size of the triangle inside the pentagon. The third shape in the third row is a cross mark, indicating a break in the pattern.

Therefore, the correct answer should be the shape that continues the pattern of increasing triangle size inside the pentagon without breaking the pattern.
