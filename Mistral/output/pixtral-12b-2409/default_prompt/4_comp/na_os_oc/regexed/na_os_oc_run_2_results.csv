1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.

Now, let's look at the options A to F:

- **A**: Contains a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.
- **B**: Contains a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.
- **C**: Contains a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.
- **D**: Contains a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.
- **E**: Contains a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.
