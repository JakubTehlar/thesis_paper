Next, let's examine the shapes in the columns:

1. **First Column**: The shapes are a small pentagon, a small pentagon, and a small pentagon.
2. **Second Column**: The shapes are a small circle, a small circle, and a small circle.
3. **Third Column**: The shapes are a small triangle, a small square, and a small triangle.

Now, let's look at the rows and columns to identify any consistent patterns:

- **First Row**: The shapes are a small circle, a small pentagon, and a small triangle.
- **Second Row**: The shapes are a small pentagon, a small circle, and a small square.
- **Third Row**: The shapes are a small triangle, a small pentagon, and a small circle.
