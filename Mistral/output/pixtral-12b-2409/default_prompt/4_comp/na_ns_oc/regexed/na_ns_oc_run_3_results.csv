0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_up_center_single_down_center_single_RAVEN_9996_val.png,D,F,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes row by row.

### Top Row:
- Shapes: Square, Large Circle, Hexagon, Small Circle, Triangle, Large Hexagon
- Pattern: The shapes vary in size and shape, but there is no clear pattern in this row.

### Middle Row:
- Shapes: Large Circle, Small Hexagon, Triangle, Large Hexagon, Small Hexagon, Large Hexagon
- Pattern: The shapes alternate between large hexagons and other shapes. The large hexagon appears twice.

### Bottom Row:
- Shapes: Large Circle, Small Hexagon, Triangle, Large Hexagon, Small Hexagon, Large Hexagon
- Pattern: Similar to the middle row, the large hexagon appears twice.

### Overall Pattern:
- The large hexagon appears twice in both the middle and bottom rows.
- The large circle appears once in the top and bottom rows.
- The small hexagon appears once in the top and bottom rows.
- The triangle appears once in the top and bottom rows.

Given this analysis, the pattern seems to involve the repetition of the large hexagon. Therefore, the correct answer should be the large hexagon.
