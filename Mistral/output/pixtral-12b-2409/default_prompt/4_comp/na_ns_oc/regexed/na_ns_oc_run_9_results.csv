1. **First Row:**
   - Shapes: Square, Hexagon, Triangle
   - Colors: Dark, Light, Dark

2. **Second Row:**
   - Shapes: Circle, Pentagon, Hexagon
   - Colors: Dark, Light, Dark

3. **Third Row:**
   - Shapes: Circle, Pentagon, Hexagon
   - Colors: Dark, Dark, Light

4. **Fourth Row:**
   - Shapes: Square, Hexagon, Cross
   - Colors: Light, Dark, Light

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the shapes and their positions. The shapes in the first column are Circle, Circle, and Circle. The second column has Pentagon, Pentagon, and Hexagon. The third column has Triangle, Hexagon, and Cross.

The pattern seems to be alternating between different shapes without a clear color pattern. Let's focus on the shapes:

- First Column: Circle, Circle, Circle
- Second Column: Pentagon, Pentagon, Hexagon
- Third Column: Triangle, Hexagon, Cross

The pattern alternates between different shapes in each column. The empty box is in the third row and second column. The shapes in the second column are Pentagon and Hexagon. The shape in the third row and second column should be a Pentagon to follow the pattern.

Therefore, the correct answer is a Pentagon.

The correct answer is: F"
1,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9978_test.png,C,C,True,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the shapes across the rows and columns. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Shapes in Each Column:**
   - Column 1: Circle, Pentagon, Pentagon
   - Column 2: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
   - Column 3: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon

2. **Identify the Shapes in Each Row:**
   - Row 1: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
   - Row 2: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
   - Row 3: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon

3. **Analyze the Patterns:**
   - The shapes in the first column change from a circle to pentagons.
   - The shapes in the second column remain consistent with pentagons.
   - The shapes in the third column remain consistent with pentagons.

4. **Determine the Shape for the Empty Box:**
   - Since the second and third columns have consistent shapes (pentagons), the pattern suggests that the empty box should also contain a pentagon.

5. **Verify the Options:**
   - Options A, C, D, E, and F are pentagons.
   - Options B and G are circles.

Given the consistency of pentagons in the second and third columns, the correct answer must be a pentagon.

2,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_center_single_RAVEN_9769_test.png,C,F,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: Square, Hexagon, Pentagon
2. Middle row: Pentagon, Square, Hexagon
3. Bottom row: Pentagon, Square, Hexagon

Now, let's look at the options provided:

A. Small Square
B. Medium Square
C. Large Square
D. Dark Triangle
E. Light Triangle
F. Small Square

To determine the pattern, we need to consider the shape types and their transformations. The shapes in the grid are squares, pentagons, and hexagons. The pattern might involve a transformation from one shape to another or a change in size or shading.

Let's analyze the transformations:

- The top row has a square, hexagon, and pentagon.
- The middle row has a pentagon, square, and hexagon.
- The bottom row has a pentagon, square, and hexagon.

The pattern seems to alternate between squares, pentagons, and hexagons. The transformation might involve changing the shape type or size.

Given the options, the correct answer should be a square, as the pattern alternates between squares, pentagons, and hexagons. The squares are present in the top and middle rows, and the bottom row has a pentagon and hexagon.

Therefore, the correct answer is a square.

The correct answer is: F"

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - The grid contains the following shapes: circle, square, triangle, pentagon, and hexagon.

2. **Observe the arrangement of the shapes:**
   - The shapes are arranged in a 3x3 grid with one empty space marked by a question mark (?).

3. **Determine the pattern:**
   - The pattern appears to involve the transformation or rotation of shapes. Each shape in the grid is rotated or transformed in a specific way.

1. The shapes in the grid are circles, pentagons, and triangles.
2. Each shape contains a specific arrangement of dots.

Let's look at the arrangement of dots in each shape:

- Top row: Circle (3 dots), Pentagon (3 dots), Triangle (3 dots)
- Middle row: Circle (2 dots), Pentagon (2 dots), Triangle (2 dots)
- Bottom row: Circle (2 dots), Pentagon (2 dots), Triangle (2 dots)

From this, we can see that the pattern involves alternating between shapes with 2 and 3 dots. The empty box in the grid is in the middle row, which should contain shapes with 2 dots.

- A: Triangle with 3 dots
- B: Triangle with 3 dots
- C: Triangle with 3 dots
- D: Triangle with 2 dots
- E: Triangle with 2 dots
