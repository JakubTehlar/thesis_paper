The shapes in the grid are arranged in a specific sequence that follows a logical progression. Let's break down the pattern step-by-step:

1. **Identify the shapes in each row:**
   - First row: Square, Hexagon, Triangle
   - Second row: Circle, Pentagon, Hexagon
   - Third row: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle

2. **Observe the transformation between shapes:**
   - From the first to the second row:
     - Square (First row) transforms to Circle (Second row)
     - Hexagon (First row) transforms to Pentagon (Second row)
     - Triangle (First row) transforms to Hexagon (Second row)
   - From the second to the third row:
     - Circle (Second row) transforms to Circle (Third row)
     - Pentagon (Second row) transforms to Pentagon (Third row)
     - Hexagon (Second row) transforms to Triangle (Third row)

3. **Identify the pattern of transformation:**
   - Square → Circle
   - Hexagon → Pentagon
   - Triangle → Hexagon
   - Circle → Circle
   - Pentagon → Pentagon
   - Hexagon → Triangle

4. **Determine the shape for the empty box:**
   - The empty box is in the third row and second column.
   - The shape in the second row and second column is a Pentagon.
   - According to the pattern, a Pentagon should transform into a Pentagon.

Therefore, the correct answer is a Pentagon.

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - Top row: Square, Hexagon, Pentagon
   - Middle row: Pentagon, Square, Hexagon
   - Bottom row: Pentagon, Square, Triangle

2. **Determine the pattern:**
   - The shapes alternate between polygons and non-polygons.
   - The shapes also alternate between filled and unfilled.

3. **Analyze the pattern of the shapes:**
   - The top row: Square (filled), Hexagon (unfilled), Pentagon (filled)
   - The middle row: Pentagon (filled), Square (unfilled), Hexagon (filled)
   - The bottom row: Pentagon (unfilled), Square (filled), Triangle (unfilled)

4. **Identify the missing shape:**
   - The empty box is in the bottom row, third column.
   - The previous shape in the third column is a Triangle (unfilled).
   - The shape before the Triangle in the third column is a Square (filled).

5. **Determine the correct shape:**
   - The pattern alternates between polygons and non-polygons.
   - The pattern alternates between filled and unfilled shapes.
   - The previous shape in the third column is a Triangle (unfilled), so the next shape should be a filled polygon.

6. **Match the pattern with the options:**

   - Option B: Medium filled square
   - Option C: Large filled square
   - Option D: Large filled triangle
   - Option E: Medium filled triangle

3,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9940_train.png,G,G,True,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are squares.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are circles.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are triangles.

Next, let's look at the columns to see if there is a pattern connecting the rows:

1. **First Column**: Square, Circle, Triangle.
2. **Second Column**: Square, Circle, Circle.
3. **Third Column**: Square, Circle, Triangle.

From this, we can see that the pattern alternates between squares, circles, and triangles in each column.

Given that the empty box is in the third column and the second row, we need to determine which shape fits the pattern. The second row currently has circles, and the third column alternates between circles and triangles. Therefore, the shape that fits the pattern is a triangle.

Thus, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is: **G**."
4,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_ns_oc_up_center_single_down_center_single_RAVEN_9973_train.png,E,A,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the patterns in the shapes within the grid. Let's break down the elements:

1. **Shape Types**: The grid contains various shapes including pentagons, triangles, circles, and squares.
2. **Color Shading**: The shapes vary in shading from light gray to dark gray and black.
3. **Positional Patterns**: The shapes are arranged in a specific pattern within the grid.

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the consistent pattern across the rows and columns.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Row**:
   - Shapes: Pentagon, Triangle, Circle
   - Shading: Light gray, Dark gray, Dark gray

2. **Second Row**:
   - Shapes: Triangle, Circle, Square
   - Shading: Dark gray, Dark gray, Light gray

3. **Third Row**:
   - Shapes: Pentagon, Triangle, Cross
   - Shading: Dark gray, Dark gray, Light gray

4. **Column Analysis**:

   - **Second Column**: Triangle (Dark gray), Triangle (Dark gray), Triangle (Dark gray)
   - **Third Column**: Circle (Dark gray), Square (Light gray), Cross (Light gray)

### Identifying the Pattern:
- The pattern seems to be consistent in the type of shape across the columns.
- The shading pattern does not seem to follow a consistent rule.

Given the above analysis, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be consistent with the shape pattern in the columns.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is the shape that matches the pattern in the first column, which is a pentagon.

     - Circle remains the same.
     - Pentagon rotates to the next shape in the sequence.
     - Square rotates to the next shape in the sequence.
     - Triangle rotates to the next shape in the sequence.

4. **Apply the pattern to the empty box**:
   - The empty box is in the middle row, second column.
   - The shape above it is a Pentagon.
   - Rotating a Pentagon 90 degrees clockwise results in a Square.

Therefore, the correct shape to fill the empty box is a Square.

From the analysis, it appears that the shapes alternate between different types in each row and column. The pattern seems to involve alternating between different geometric shapes.

Given the empty box is in the third column and second row, we need to determine which shape fits the pattern. The shapes in the third column are Square, Circle, and Pentagon. The shapes in the second row are Triangle, Hexagon, and Circle.

Considering the pattern, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be consistent with the alternating pattern observed. The empty box is in the second row and third column, which means it should follow the pattern of the shapes in the third column.
