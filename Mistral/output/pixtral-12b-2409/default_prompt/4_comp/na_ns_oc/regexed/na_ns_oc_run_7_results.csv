The grid consists of three rows and three columns, with each cell containing a different shape. The shapes vary in form, size, and color.

Let's break down the patterns:

1. **Shape Transformation**:
   - The shapes in the first column change from a small square to a larger square, then to a circle.
   - The shapes in the second column change from a small square to a pentagon, then to a hexagon.
   - The shapes in the third column change from a small square to a triangle, then to a larger triangle.

2. **Color Transformation**:
   - The colors in the first column change from black to gray to white.
   - The colors in the second column change from black to gray to white.
   - The colors in the third column change from black to gray to white.

3. **Size Transformation**:
   - The sizes in the first column change from small to medium to large.
   - The sizes in the second column change from small to medium to large.
   - The sizes in the third column change from small to medium to large.

Given these patterns, we need to determine which shape fits in the empty box in the third column of the third row. The third column follows a pattern of black to gray to white in color, small to medium to large in size, and small square to triangle to larger triangle in shape.

The empty box is black, medium in size, and needs to be a larger triangle.

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a circle, a triangle, and a square.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a pentagon, a triangle, and a hexagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a square, and a pentagon.

Next, we need to determine the pattern that connects these shapes. One possible pattern could be based on the number of sides of the shapes:

- Circle: 0 sides
- Triangle: 3 sides
- Square: 4 sides
- Pentagon: 5 sides
- Hexagon: 6 sides

The pattern might involve alternating the number of sides or following a specific sequence.

- **Middle Row**: Pentagon (5), Triangle (3), Hexagon (6)
- **Bottom Row**: Triangle (3), Square (4), Pentagon (5)

From this, we can see that the sequence alternates between shapes with different numbers of sides. The empty box in the middle row should follow this pattern.

Given the sequence:
- The previous shape is a Triangle (3 sides).
- The next shape should have a different number of sides.

The options available are:
- A: Triangle (3 sides)
- B: Triangle (3 sides)
- C: Square (4 sides)
