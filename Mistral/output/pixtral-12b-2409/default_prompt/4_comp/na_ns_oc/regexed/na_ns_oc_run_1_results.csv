3. **Determine the pattern:**
   - The shapes in the grid are varied and do not seem to follow a straightforward geometric progression (e.g., size or number of sides).
   - The pattern might be based on the orientation or arrangement of the shapes.

4. **Analyze the orientation:**
   - The shapes in the grid are oriented in different ways (upright, inverted, slanted).
   - The empty box has a cross mark, which could indicate an orientation or a specific shape.

5. **Match the pattern:**
   - The cross mark in the empty box suggests it might be a shape that is not present in the grid.
   - The shapes in the grid include triangles, diamonds, pentagons, and hexagons, but no crosses.
