The shapes in the grid are arranged in a specific sequence, and we need to determine the rule governing the transition from one shape to the next.

1. **Identify the shapes in each row:**
   - First row: Square, Hexagon, Triangle
   - Second row: Large Circle, Pentagon, Small Circle
   - Third row: Small Circle, Hexagon, Cross

2. **Observe the patterns:**
   - The first row has a progression from a small square to a large square, then to a triangle.
   - The second row has a progression from a large circle to a pentagon, then to a small circle.
   - The third row has a progression from a small circle to a hexagon, then to a cross.

3. **Determine the rule:**
   - The progression seems to involve a change in size and shape complexity.
   - From the first row, the shapes increase in complexity: small square -> large square -> triangle.
   - From the second row, the shapes increase in complexity: large circle -> pentagon -> small circle.
   - From the third row, the shapes increase in complexity: small circle -> hexagon -> cross.

4. **Apply the rule to the empty box:**
   - The empty box is in the third row and third column.
   - The previous shape in the third row is a hexagon.
   - Following the complexity rule, the next shape should be a cross.

Therefore, the correct answer is the shape that fits the pattern of increasing complexity, which is a cross.

The correct answer is: F"
