1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a square.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a diamond, and a triangle.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a square.

Next, we need to look at the patterns in each column:

1. **First Column**: Contains a circle, a hexagon, and a circle.
2. **Second Column**: Contains a hexagon, a diamond, and a hexagon.
3. **Third Column**: Contains a square, a triangle, and a square.

Now, let's analyze the rows and columns for any repeating patterns:

- **First Column**: The shapes alternate between circles and hexagons.
- **Second Column**: The shapes alternate between hexagons and diamonds.
- **Third Column**: The shapes alternate between squares and triangles.

Given the empty box is in the third column and second row, we need to determine the pattern for this specific position. The third column alternates between squares and triangles. The shape above the empty box is a square, so the next shape in the sequence should be a triangle.

Therefore, the correct answer is a triangle.

Now, let's look at the options provided (A to F):

- A: Small Square
- B: Small Diamond
- C: Small Circle
- D: Large Circle
- E: Large Square
- F: Large Diamond

To determine the pattern, we need to observe the sequence of shapes in the rows and columns. The shapes alternate between Circle, Square, and Diamond. This suggests that the pattern involves a rotation or transformation of these shapes.

Let's examine the empty box in the grid (marked with a question mark ?):

- The shape above the empty box is a Diamond.
- The shape to the left of the empty box is a Circle.
- The shape to the right of the empty box is a Square.

Next, let's look at the options provided:

- A: Large Circle
- B: Small Triangle
- C: Small Pentagon
- D: Small Circle
- E: Large Circle

2. The shapes in the second row are a circle, a circle, and a circle.
3. The shapes in the third row are a diamond with three small squares, a diamond with three small circles, and an empty diamond with a question mark.

To determine the pattern, let's look at the shapes in the first column:
- The first shape is a pentagon.
- The second shape is a circle.
- The third shape is a diamond with three small squares.

Now, let's look at the shapes in the second column:
- The first shape is a pentagon.
- The second shape is a circle.

Finally, let's look at the shapes in the third column:
- The first shape is a pentagon.
- The second shape is a circle.
- The third shape is an empty diamond with a question mark.

From this analysis, we can see that the pattern alternates between pentagons and circles in the first two rows. The third row seems to follow a pattern of shapes within diamonds. Since the third row has an empty diamond with a question mark, we need to find a shape that fits the pattern of the third row.

Looking at the options (A to F), we see that:
- A: Diamond with three small squares.
- B: Diamond with one small square.
- C: Diamond with three small squares.
- D: Diamond with three small circles.
- E: Diamond with one small circle.
- F: Diamond with one small square.

We need to determine the pattern that could connect these shapes. One possible approach is to look for a consistent transformation or relationship between the shapes in the grid.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the shapes in the grid are transitioning from more complex to simpler forms. The top row has a pentagon, diamond, and triangle, which are all complex polygons. The middle row has two pentagons and a diamond, which are still complex shapes but simpler than the triangle. The bottom row has a circle and a cross, which are the simplest shapes.

Given this pattern, the correct choice should be the simplest shape among the options provided. The simplest shape is a circle.

- The bottom row has a Pentagon in the first and second columns.
- Therefore, the third column should have a Square.

For the inner shape:
- The sequence is Triangle, Pentagon, Diamond.
- The bottom row has a Diamond in the second column.
- Therefore, the third column should have a Cross.

Thus, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a Square with a Cross inside it.

3. Bottom row: Diamond with a circle, Triangle with a gray triangle, Triangle with a black pentagon, Circle with a gray triangle, Circle with a gray triangle, Circle with a gray triangle, Circle with a gray pentagon, Triangle with a gray triangle.

To find the pattern, let's look at the shapes and their transformations:

- The shapes change from one geometric figure to another.
- The fillings inside the shapes also change.

Let's analyze the transformations:

1. From the top row to the middle row:
   - Triangle with a circle → Circle with a black hexagon
   - Circle with a hexagon → Diamond with a gray square
   - Square with a pentagon → Triangle with a gray triangle

2. From the middle row to the bottom row:
   - Circle with a black hexagon → Diamond with a circle
   - Diamond with a gray square → Triangle with a gray triangle
   - Triangle with a gray triangle → Triangle with a black pentagon

3. From the bottom row to the next set of shapes:
   - Diamond with a circle → Circle with a gray triangle
   - Triangle with a gray triangle → Circle with a gray triangle
   - Triangle with a black pentagon → Circle with a gray pentagon
   - Circle with a gray triangle → Triangle with a gray triangle

The pattern seems to involve alternating between different geometric figures and their fillings. The shapes transition from triangles to circles to diamonds and back to triangles, with the fillings changing accordingly.
