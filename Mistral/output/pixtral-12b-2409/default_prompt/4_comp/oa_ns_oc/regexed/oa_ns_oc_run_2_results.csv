To find the pattern, we need to look for a consistent transformation or relationship between the shapes in each row and column.

- **Rows**:
  - Top Row: Circle, Square, Diamond
  - Middle Row: Pentagon, Square, Hexagon
  - Bottom Row: Circle, Square, Diamond

  The shapes in the top and bottom rows are similar, with the middle row being different.

- **Columns**:
  - First Column: Diamond, Pentagon, Circle
  - Second Column: Square, Square, Square
  - Third Column: Diamond, Circle, Diamond

  The shapes in the second column are all squares, while the first and third columns have a mix of shapes.

Given the pattern, it appears that the middle row might be a transformation or a different set of shapes compared to the top and bottom rows. The second column being all squares suggests a possible pattern of repetition or a different characteristic.

To fill the empty box, we need to consider the shape that would complete the pattern in the third column. The third column currently has a diamond, a circle, and a diamond. The pattern suggests that the shape should be consistent with the other columns.

Since the second column is all squares, and the third column alternates between diamonds and circles, the empty box should be filled with a square to maintain the pattern.

Therefore, the correct answer is a square.

- Top row: pentagon (dark), diamond (light), triangle (dark)
- Middle row: pentagon (dark), pentagon (dark), diamond (light)
- Bottom row: circle (dark), pentagon (dark), cross (light)

The pattern alternates between dark and light shapes. Therefore, the missing shape should follow this alternation.

- The top row ends with a dark shape (triangle).
- The middle row ends with a light shape (diamond).
- The bottom row ends with a light shape (cross).

Following the pattern, the missing shape should be dark. The options are:
