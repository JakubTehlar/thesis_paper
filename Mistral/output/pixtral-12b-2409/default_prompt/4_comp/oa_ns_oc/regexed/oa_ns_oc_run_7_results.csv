2. The shapes in the second row are a circle, a circle, and a circle.
3. The shapes in the third row are a diamond with two small squares, a diamond with three small circles, and an empty diamond with a question mark.

To determine the pattern, we need to consider the transformation from one shape to another. The shapes in the first row are all pentagons, the shapes in the second row are all circles, and the shapes in the third row are all diamonds. The transformation seems to involve changing the shape type and the number of small shapes inside the diamond.

Let's analyze the options A to F:

- **A**: Diamond with three small circles.
- **B**: Diamond with one small circle.
- **C**: Diamond with three small circles.
- **D**: Diamond with three small circles.
- **E**: Diamond with one small circle.
- **F**: Diamond with one small circle.

The pattern in the third row involves diamonds with different numbers of small circles. The first diamond has two small squares, the second has three small circles, and the third has an empty diamond. The pattern seems to be increasing the number of small circles from two to three.

Given this pattern, the correct answer should be a diamond with three small circles. Options A, C, and D all fit this pattern. However, we need to ensure that the pattern continues correctly in the grid.

Considering the sequence of the third row:
- The first diamond has two small squares.
- The second diamond has three small circles.
- The third diamond is empty.

Following the pattern, the next diamond should have four small circles. However, since we only have options with one or three small circles, the pattern might be cyclical or have another rule.

Given the options and the pattern of increasing the number of small circles, the closest match is a diamond with three small circles.
