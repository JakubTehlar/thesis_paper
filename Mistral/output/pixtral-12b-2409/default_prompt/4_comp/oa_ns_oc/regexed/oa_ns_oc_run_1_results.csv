1. Top row: Pentagon, Diamond, Triangle
2. Middle row: Pentagon, Irregular Pentagon, Diamond
3. Bottom row: Circle, Pentagon, Cross

Next, we examine the options provided:

A. Large Circle
B. Small Circle
C. Small Dark Circle
D. Light Gray Pentagon
E. Dark Small Pentagon
F. Light Gray Circle

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the properties of the shapes, such as their color, size, and shape type. The shapes in the grid are varied in terms of color (light gray, dark gray, black), size (small, large), and shape type (circle, pentagon, diamond, triangle, cross).

One possible pattern could be the alternation of shapes between rows. However, this pattern does not hold consistently across the grid. Another pattern could be the alternation of colors or sizes, but this also does not hold consistently.

Given the variety and lack of a clear pattern in the grid, the most logical approach is to match the shape type of the empty box with the shape type in the options provided. The empty box is a cross, which is not present in the options.

Therefore, the correct answer is based on the closest matching shape type and color. The closest match in shape type and color is the small dark circle (C).
