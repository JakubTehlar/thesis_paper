0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9999_test.png,E,D,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the 3x3 grid and determine which shape completes the sequence correctly.

First, let's examine the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: Square, Circle, Square
2. Middle row: Circle, Square, Circle
3. Bottom row: Square, Circle, Square

Next, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the arrangement of these shapes. One possible pattern could be the alternation of shapes between rows and columns.

Let's analyze the options A to F:

- **Option A**: Contains only squares.
- **Option B**: Contains only squares.
- **Option C**: Contains only circles.
- **Option D**: Contains a mix of squares and circles.
- **Option E**: Contains a mix of squares and circles.
- **Option F**: Contains a mix of squares and circles.

Given the pattern in the grid, the shapes alternate between squares and circles. Therefore, the correct option should also alternate between squares and circles.

- **Option A**: All squares (does not fit the pattern).
- **Option B**: All squares (does not fit the pattern).
- **Option C**: All circles (does not fit the pattern).
- **Option D**: Alternates between squares and circles (fits the pattern).
- **Option E**: Alternates between squares and circles (fits the pattern).
- **Option F**: Alternates between squares and circles (fits the pattern).

Among the options that fit the pattern, the correct answer is the one that maintains the alternation seen in the grid.

The correct answer is: **D**."
1,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_distribute_four_RAVEN_9999_test.png,G,C,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern in the grid. Let's break down the shapes and their positions:

1. **Top Row**: Contains six hexagonal shapes.
2. **Middle Row**: Contains five pentagonal shapes and one cross (X).
3. **Bottom Row**: Contains a mix of circles, triangles, and pentagons.

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the relationships between the shapes in the filled boxes and the empty box.

### Observations:
- The top row consists entirely of hexagons.
- The middle row has pentagons and one cross (X).
- The bottom row has circles, triangles, and pentagons.

### Analysis:
- The empty box is in the middle row, which currently has pentagons and one cross (X).
- To maintain the pattern, the empty box should contain a shape that fits the pattern of the middle row.

Given the options (A to F), we need to identify which shape fits the middle row pattern:

- **A**: Large circle
- **B**: Small circle
- **C**: Small pentagon
- **D**: Large pentagon
- **E**: Large triangle
- **F**: Small triangle

### Conclusion:
Since the middle row has pentagons and one cross (X), the empty box should contain a pentagon to maintain the pattern.

The correct answer is: **C**"
2,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_in_distribute_four_out_center_single_RAVEN_9964_train.png,F,A,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid:

1. The first row has three shapes: a circle in a square, a circle in a square, and a circle in a square.
2. The second row has three shapes: a circle in a triangle, a circle in a triangle, and a square in a triangle.
3. The third row has three shapes: a circle in a hexagon, a circle in a hexagon, and an ""X"" in a hexagon.

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the shapes and their positions:

- The shapes in the first row are all circles in squares.
- The shapes in the second row are circles in triangles and a square in a triangle.
- The shapes in the third row are circles in hexagons and an ""X"" in a hexagon.

Given this, the pattern seems to be that the shapes alternate between circles and other shapes (triangles, squares, hexagons) within different geometric figures.

Now, let's look at the options A to F:

- A: Circle in a hexagon
- B: Circle in a hexagon
- C: Circle in a hexagon
- D: Circle in a hexagon
- E: Circle in a hexagon
- F: Circle in a hexagon

All options from A to F show a circle in a hexagon. Since the third row has circles in hexagons, any of these options could fit the pattern. However, the question asks for the correct answer, which implies there is a unique solution.

Given the repetition of the same shape in all options, it seems there might be an error in the question. If we assume the pattern is simply placing a circle in a hexagon, then any of the options A to F would be correct.

The correct answer is: A"

   - Third box: Diamonds and squares.

2. Middle row:
   - First box: Circles.

   - Third box: Triangles pointing downwards and upwards.

3. Bottom row:
   - First box: Circles.
   - Second box: Triangles pointing downwards and upwards.
   - Third box: Crossed out.

Now, let's examine the options A to F:

- A: Two circles.
- B: Two circles.
- C: Two circles.
- D: Two circles.
- E: Two circles.
- F: Two circles.

All the options (A to F) have two circles. The pattern in the grid involves shapes that are either circles, triangles, or diamonds/squares. Since the empty box is in the third position of the bottom row, we need to find a shape that fits the pattern.

Looking at the adjacent boxes:
- The box to the left (second box in the bottom row) has triangles pointing downwards and upwards.
- The box above (second box in the middle row) has diamonds and squares.

The pattern alternates between shapes with circles, triangles, and diamonds/squares. Since the box to the left has triangles and the box above has diamonds/squares, the empty box should have circles.

Therefore, the correct answer is any option with two circles, as all options (A to F) match this pattern.

The correct answer is: A, B, C, D, E, or F."

### Analysis:
- The top row alternates between circles and polygons.
- The middle row alternates between dark and light polygons.
- The bottom row alternates between circles and polygons, with triangles and pentagons appearing in between.

Given these observations, we need to determine which shape fits in the empty box in the bottom row. The empty box is in the third column, which is currently occupied by a hexagon (dark).

### Options:
- A: Circle
- B: Triangle (light)
- C: Hexagon (dark)
- D: Circle
- E: Hexagon (dark)

   - Secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): Diamond, Square, Circle

5. **Analyze the pattern:**
   - The pattern alternates between shapes in the rows and columns.
   - The main diagonal alternates between shapes (Circle, Square, Diamond).
   - The secondary diagonal alternates between shapes (Diamond, Square, Circle).

Given the empty box is in the third row and third column, we need to determine which shape fits the pattern.

6. **Determine the shape for the empty box:**

Let's analyze the options:

- **A**: Small circle
- **B**: Black hexagon
- **C**: Large circle

- **E**: Small pentagon
- **F**: Black hexagon

Given the pattern of alternating shapes and colors, the correct answer should be a shape that fits the pattern in the empty box.

- A: Circle with hexagon.
- B: Circle with triangle.
- C: Triangle with hexagon.
- D: Triangle with triangle.
- E: Circle with hexagon.
- F: Circle with triangle.

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the relationship between the shapes in the grid. The shapes in the grid are a mix of different polygons (triangles, pentagons, circles) and different internal shapes (squares, diamonds, hexagons, triangles).

One possible pattern could be the type of internal shape within the polygons. Let's check the internal shapes:

- Top row: Square, Hexagon, Hexagon.
- Middle row: Diamond, Hexagon, Diamond.
- Bottom row: Hexagon, Triangle, Triangle.

The pattern seems to be alternating between different internal shapes within the same type of polygon. Let's check the options:

- A: Circle with hexagon (matches the pattern of alternating internal shapes).
- B: Circle with triangle (does not match the pattern).
- C: Triangle with hexagon (matches the pattern).
- D: Triangle with triangle (does not match the pattern).
- E: Circle with hexagon (matches the pattern).
- F: Circle with triangle (does not match the pattern).

Given the pattern of alternating internal shapes within the same type of polygon, the correct answer should be one that fits this pattern.

The pattern in the grid seems to alternate between different shapes and sizes. Specifically, it alternates between pentagons, triangles, and circles. The shapes also vary in size, moving from small to large and back to small.

Given this pattern, the empty box (bottom-right) should follow the sequence of shapes. The previous shape in the bottom row is a small circle, so the next shape should be a triangle, and it should be large to maintain the pattern.
