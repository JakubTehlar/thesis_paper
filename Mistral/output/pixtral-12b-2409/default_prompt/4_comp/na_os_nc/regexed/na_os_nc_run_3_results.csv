0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9999_test.png,E,D,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the patterns in the shapes and their arrangement in the grid. Let's break down the elements:

1. **Shape Analysis**:
   - The shapes include squares, circles, and pentagons.
   - Some shapes are filled, and some are outlined.

2. **Grid Analysis**:
   - The grid is a 3x3 matrix with one empty box marked with a question mark (?).

3. **Pattern Identification**:
   - The top row has a mix of shapes: a square, a pentagon, and a circle.
   - The middle row has a mix of shapes: a square, a pentagon, and a circle.
   - The bottom row has a mix of shapes: a square, a pentagon, and a circle.

4. **Shape Arrangement**:
   - The left column has a square, a pentagon, and a square.
   - The middle column has a square, a circle, and a circle.
   - The right column has a pentagon, a circle, and a circle.

5. **Filling the Empty Box**:
   - The empty box is in the middle of the grid.
   - To maintain the pattern, we need to look at the shapes around it.
   - The shapes around the empty box are a square, a pentagon, and a circle.

Given these observations, the pattern seems to alternate between different shapes without a clear sequential rule. However, the middle column has circles in the second and third rows. To maintain consistency, the empty box should also be a circle.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is: D"
1,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_distribute_four_RAVEN_9999_test.png,G,B,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern of shapes in the grid. The grid consists of eight shapes, and one box is empty. Let's examine the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: three hexagonal shapes.
2. Middle row: three pentagonal shapes.
3. Bottom row: a mix of circular, triangular, and small circular shapes.

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the relationships between the shapes. Here are the shapes in the grid:

- Top row: Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon
- Middle row: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
- Bottom row: Large Circle, Small Circle, Large Circle

The pattern appears to be based on the number of sides or the type of shape. Let's analyze the options:

- A: Large Circle
- B: Small Circle
- C: Large Triangle
- D: Large Circle
- E: Large Circle
- F: Small Triangle

The pattern in the bottom row alternates between large circles and small circles. The empty box is the third position in the bottom row. Therefore, the shape that should fill the empty box should follow the pattern of alternating between large and small circles.

The correct answer is: B"

",False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid:

1. The first row has three squares with a small circle inside them.
2. The second row has three triangles with a small circle inside them.
3. The third row has three hexagons with a small circle inside them.

The shapes are arranged in a specific order:
- First row: Square, Square, Square
- Second row: Triangle, Triangle, Triangle
- Third row: Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon

Now, let's look at the options A to F:
- A: Hexagon with one small circle
- B: Hexagon with one small circle
- C: Hexagon with three small circles
- D: Hexagon with four small circles
- E: Hexagon with five small circles
- F: Hexagon with six small circles

The pattern in the grid involves shapes with a single small circle inside them. Therefore, the correct answer should be a hexagon with one small circle.

The correct answer is: B

   - Box 3: Diamonds.

2. Middle row:
   - Box 1: Circles.

   - Box 3: Triangles pointing downwards.

3. Bottom row:
   - Box 1: Circles.
   - Box 2: Triangles pointing downwards.
   - Box 3: Empty (to be filled).

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the shapes in the adjacent boxes. The empty box in the bottom row is adjacent to boxes with circles and triangles pointing downwards.

Let's analyze the options A to F:
- A: Two circles.
- B: Two circles.
- C: Two circles.
- D: Two circles.
- E: Two circles.
- F: Two circles.

Since all options have two circles, and we see circles in the adjacent boxes, the pattern seems to involve the repetition of circles.

Therefore, the correct answer is any option with two circles, as they fit the pattern observed in the adjacent boxes.

The correct answer is: A, B, C, D, E, or F.

8,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_in_center_single_out_center_single_RAVEN_9996_val.png,E,F,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to identify the pattern that connects all the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. Top row: Triangle with square, pentagon with hexagon, circle with hexagon.
2. Middle row: Triangle with diamond, pentagon with hexagon, circle with diamond.
3. Bottom row: Triangle with hexagon, pentagon with triangle, circle with triangle.

Now, let's examine the shapes in the bottom row more closely:
- The first box has a triangle with a hexagon.
- The second box has a pentagon with a triangle.
- The third box has a circle with a triangle.

The pattern seems to involve shapes within shapes, where each shape in the first column is a triangle, and each shape in the second column is a pentagon, and each shape in the third column is a circle. The shapes inside these outer shapes follow a pattern as well.

Given the empty box is in the third column, we need to find a shape that fits the pattern of the third column. The third column has a circle with a triangle and a circle with a triangle. Therefore, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a circle with a triangle.

- The shading alternates between shaded and unshaded.

### Applying the Pattern:
- For the empty box in the third column, second row, we need to determine the correct shape and shading.
- The third column, second row, should have an unshaded hexagon.
