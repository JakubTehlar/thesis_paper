1,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_distribute_four_RAVEN_9999_test.png,G,C,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern of the shapes in the grid. The grid has the following layout:

```
[ ] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [X] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [ ]
```

Let's examine the shapes in the filled boxes:

1. Top-left: Pentagon
2. Top-middle: Pentagon
3. Top-right: Pentagon
4. Middle-left: Pentagon
5. Middle-middle: Pentagon
6. Middle-right: Pentagon
7. Bottom-left: Large circle
8. Bottom-middle: Small circle
9. Bottom-right: Large circle

2,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_in_distribute_four_out_center_single_RAVEN_9964_train.png,F,C,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid:

1. The first row has three shapes: a square with a circle, a square with a smaller circle, and a square with an even smaller circle.
2. The second row has three shapes: a triangle with a circle, a triangle with a smaller circle, and a triangle with a square inside.
3. The third row has three shapes: a hexagon with a circle, a hexagon with a smaller circle, and a hexagon with an even smaller circle.

From this analysis, we can see that the pattern involves shapes with circles of varying sizes and one shape with a square inside a triangle. The progression seems to be from larger to smaller circles within the same shape type (square, triangle, hexagon).

Given the options A to F, we need to find the shape that fits this pattern:

- A: Hexagon with a circle
- B: Hexagon with a smaller circle
- C: Hexagon with even smaller circles
- D: Hexagon with even smaller circles
- E: Hexagon with a circle

1. Top row: 
   - Box 1: Triangles (pointing up and down)
   - Box 2: Circles
   - Box 3: Diamonds

2. Middle row:
   - Box 4: Circles
   - Box 5: Diamonds
   - Box 6: Triangles (pointing up and down)

3. Bottom row:
   - Box 7: Circles

Next, let's look at the options A to F:
   - A: Two circles
   - B: Two circles
   - C: Two circles
   - D: Two circles
   - E: Two circles
   - F: Two circles

The pattern in the grid involves shapes that are repeated in a specific sequence. Observing the grid, we see that circles appear in the first and fourth boxes of the top and middle rows, and in the seventh box of the bottom row. Triangles (pointing up and down) appear in the first and sixth boxes of the top and middle rows, and in the eighth box of the bottom row. Diamonds appear in the second and fifth boxes of the top and middle rows.

Since the empty box (Box 9) is in the bottom row and the pattern alternates between shapes, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be the same as the shape in the seventh box, which is circles.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

4,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9992_train.png,C,B,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern in the grid. The grid has a 3x3 arrangement with shapes in each box except for the bottom right box, which is empty. Let's break down the shapes and their positions:

1. **Top Row**: Circle, Square, Pentagon
2. **Middle Row**: Hexagon, Diamond, Circle, Pentagon
3. **Bottom Row**: Hexagon, Triangle, Pentagon, Hexagon, Triangle, Circle, Pentagon, Triangle, Hexagon

Next, let's identify the pattern by looking at the shapes in the columns and rows:

- **Column 1**: Circle, Hexagon, Circle
- **Column 2**: Square, Diamond, Triangle
- **Column 3**: Pentagon, Circle, Pentagon
- **Column 4**: Pentagon, Hexagon, Hexagon
- **Column 5**: Pentagon, Hexagon, Triangle
- **Column 6**: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle
- **Column 7**: Hexagon, Triangle, Hexagon

From the above, we can see that the shapes alternate in a specific sequence. Let's focus on the bottom row to determine the correct shape for the empty box:

- **Bottom Row**: Hexagon, Triangle, Pentagon, Hexagon, Triangle, Circle, Pentagon, Triangle, Hexagon

The empty box is in the bottom right corner, which is the 9th position. The pattern in the bottom row alternates between shapes. The 8th position has a Triangle, so the 9th position should follow the pattern.

Looking at the options (A to F), we need to find the shape that fits the pattern:

- **A**: Circle
- **B**: Triangle
- **C**: Pentagon
- **D**: Hexagon
- **E**: Triangle
- **F**: Circle

Given the pattern, the correct shape for the empty box should be a Triangle, as it follows the sequence of shapes in the bottom row.

5,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9992_train.png,C,E,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a circle, a diamond, and a square.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a circle, and a diamond.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a pentagon, and a square.

Next, let's look at the shapes in the columns:

1. **First Column**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a hexagon.
2. **Second Column**: The shapes are a diamond, a circle, and a pentagon.
3. **Third Column**: The shapes are a square, a diamond, and a square.

Now, let's examine the rows and columns for any consistent pattern:

- **Top Row**: Circle, Diamond, Square
- **Middle Row**: Hexagon, Circle, Diamond
- **Bottom Row**: Hexagon, Pentagon, Square

- **First Column**: Circle, Hexagon, Hexagon
- **Second Column**: Diamond, Circle, Pentagon
- **Third Column**: Square, Diamond, Square

From the rows and columns, we can see that the shapes alternate between different types. Specifically, the shapes in the first column are all hexagons, which suggests that the pattern might involve alternating between different types of polygons.

Given that the empty box is in the third column and the third row, we need to determine which shape fits the pattern. The third column currently has a square and a diamond. The third row has a hexagon, a pentagon, and a square. To maintain the pattern, we should look for a shape that alternates with the existing shapes.

The correct answer is a hexagon, which would fit the pattern of alternating shapes in the columns and rows.

   - Observation: The shapes are different in each row.

6. **Third Column:**
   - Shapes: Pentagon, Pentagon, Circle
   - Observation: The shapes are different in each row.

From the above observations, it appears that each column contains different shapes, and each row contains different shapes. This suggests that the pattern might be based on the uniqueness of shapes within each row and column.

Given the options:
- A: Circle
- B: Pentagon
- C: Pentagon
- D: Pentagon
- E: Pentagon
- F: Pentagon

Since the pattern requires unique shapes in each row and column, the correct answer must be a shape that is not repeated in the same row or column.

Looking at the options:
- The first row already has a Circle, Pentagon, and Hexagon.
- The second row already has a Pentagon, Circle, and Hexagon.
- The third row already has a Pentagon, Circle, and Hexagon.

The correct answer must be a shape that is not repeated in the same row or column. The only shape that fits this criterion is the Circle (A), as it is not repeated in any row or column.
