- The shape above it (in the second row) is a pentagon.
- The shape to its left (in the second column) is a small circle.
- The shape to its right (in the third column) is a triangle.

Given these observations, the pattern might involve the type of shape rather than size. The empty box should be filled with a shape that fits the pattern of the adjacent shapes.

1. **Observation of the Grid:**
   - The grid consists of various shapes: circles, squares, diamonds, and pentagons.
   - The shapes are arranged in a specific pattern, and one box is empty.

2. **Identifying the Pattern:**
   - The shapes in the grid are arranged in a way that suggests a transformation or relationship between them.
   - We need to determine the rule governing the arrangement and transformation of the shapes.

3. **Analyzing the Shapes:**
   - The shapes in the grid include circles, squares, diamonds, and pentagons.
   - The shapes are placed in a sequence that may involve rotation, reflection, or a combination of these transformations.

4. **Matching the Shapes:**

1. **Shape Pattern**: Each row and column contains different shapes. The shapes include circles, hexagons, and squares, each in various shades of gray and black.

2. **Color Pattern**: The colors alternate between black and gray. The first and third rows have alternating black and gray shapes, while the second row has alternating black and gray shapes.

3. **Shape Rotation**: Some shapes are rotated. For example, hexagons can be upright or rotated by 180 degrees.

Given these observations, let's analyze the empty cell's row and column:

- **Row 3**: Contains shapes A, B, and C.
- **Column 3**: Contains shapes C, D, and H.

1. Top row: Triangle with square, Pentagon with hexagon, Circle with hexagon.
2. Middle row: Triangle with diamond, Pentagon with hexagon, Circle with diamond.
3. Bottom row: Triangle with hexagon, Pentagon with triangle, Circle with triangle.

We need to determine the relationship between the shapes in the boxes. One possible pattern could be the type of polygon (triangle, pentagon, circle) and the type of internal shape (square, diamond, hexagon, triangle).

Let's break down the pattern:
- The first column: Triangle with square, Triangle with diamond, Triangle with hexagon.
- The second column: Pentagon with hexagon, Pentagon with triangle, Pentagon with triangle.
- The third column: Circle with hexagon, Circle with diamond, Circle with triangle.

The pattern seems to be that the internal shape changes while the outer shape remains the same across each row.

Given this pattern, the empty box (marked with a question mark) should follow the pattern of the third column, where the outer shape is a circle. The internal shape should match the pattern of the third column, which alternates between hexagon, diamond, and triangle.

Since the third column already has a circle with a hexagon and a circle with a diamond, the next shape should be a circle with a triangle.

Therefore, the correct answer is a circle with a triangle inside.
