0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_ns_nc_center_single_RAVEN_9930_train.png,H,F,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid row by row.

1. **First Row:**
   - Shapes: Large triangle (gray), pentagon (gray), large circle (gray)
   - Pattern: All shapes are filled with gray color.

2. **Second Row:**
   - Shapes: Small triangle (white), small pentagon (white), small circle (gray)
   - Pattern: The small circle is gray, while the other shapes are white.

3. **Third Row:**
   - Shapes: Empty triangle, pentagon, cross (X)
   - Pattern: The shapes are empty (white).

From the above observations, we can deduce the following patterns:
- The first row has shapes filled with gray.
- The second row has shapes where the small circle is gray, and the others are white.
- The third row has empty shapes.

Now, let's look at the options provided:
- **A:** Large black triangle
- **B:** Small white triangle
- **C:** Large black circle
- **D:** Large black circle
- **E:** Small white triangle
- **F:** Empty circle

Given the patterns observed:
- The empty box in the grid should follow the pattern of the third row, which has empty shapes.

Thus, the correct answer is an empty circle, which matches option **F**.

The correct answer is: **F**."

2. Middle row: Circle with a circle, pentagon with a triangle, triangle with a hexagon.
3. Bottom row: Circle with a triangle, pentagon with a hexagon, cross mark.

The pattern seems to involve a combination of shapes, where each shape in the grid is composed of two different shapes. Let's break down the pattern:

- The first shape in the top row is a circle with a hexagon inside.
- The second shape in the top row is a pentagon with a circle inside.
- The third shape in the top row is a triangle with a triangle inside.

Following this pattern, we see that each shape in the grid is composed of two different shapes.

Now, let's look at the options A to F:

- A: Triangle with a triangle inside.
- B: Pentagon with a circle inside.
- C: Pentagon with a hexagon inside.
- D: Pentagon with a triangle inside.
- E: Pentagon with a circle inside.
- F: Pentagon with a triangle inside.

Given the pattern, the correct answer should be a shape that follows the pattern of combining two different shapes. The empty box is in the bottom row, third column, which currently has a cross mark. The pattern suggests that the next shape should be a pentagon with a hexagon inside.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The pattern alternates between different shapes, and we can see that the shapes in the top row are pentagon, triangle, and diamond. The middle row has diamond, circle, and cross. The bottom row has hexagon, triangle, and diamond.

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify which shape completes the pattern in the empty box. The empty box is in the middle row, third column.

2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a hexagon, and a square.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a diamond, a hexagon, and a square.

Next, let's look at the options provided (A to F):

- **A**: Contains a diamond, a hexagon, and a square.
- **B**: Contains a diamond, a hexagon, and a square.
- **C**: Contains a triangle, a hexagon, and a square.
- **D**: Contains a diamond, a hexagon, and a square.
- **E**: Contains a diamond, a hexagon, and a square.
- **F**: Contains a diamond, a hexagon, and a square.

From the grid, we observe that the shapes alternate between a diamond, a hexagon, and a square. This pattern is consistent across all rows.

Let's verify the options:

1. The top row has: a hexagon, a pentagon, and a small square.
2. The middle row has: a small pentagon, a diamond, and a triangle.
3. The bottom row has: a circle, a small hexagon, and an 'X'.

- A: Hexagon
- B: Pentagon
- C: Dark pentagon
- D: Dark hexagon
- E: Dark pentagon
- F: Dark pentagon
- G: Pentagon
- H: Hexagon

To determine the pattern, we need to consider the shapes' properties, such as their number of sides and whether they are filled or not.

Upon examining the grid, we notice that the shapes alternate between polygons and non-polygons. Additionally, the shapes vary in complexity and orientation. The empty box is in the middle row, third column, which currently has an 'X'.

Given these observations, we need to find a shape that fits the pattern of alternating between polygons and non-polygons, and also matches the complexity and orientation of the surrounding shapes.

B. Diamond with a square inside
C. Diamond with a square inside
D. Diamond with a square inside
E. Diamond with a square inside
F. Diamond with a square inside

All the options (A to F) show a diamond shape with a square inside. This suggests that the pattern might involve a transformation of shapes from one form to another.

Let's analyze the transformations in the grid:

- The Triangle transforms to a Circle.
- The Circle transforms to a Square.
- The Square transforms to a Triangle.

Following this pattern, the empty box (which is currently a Triangle) should transform to a Circle.

9. **Ninth Row:**
   - Shapes: Pentagon, Hexagon, Triangle
   - Observation: The shapes are different in each box.

Given the patterns observed, it appears that the shapes are arranged in a way that each box contains a unique shape. Therefore, the correct answer should be a shape that fits this pattern of uniqueness.

Among the options A to F, we need to identify the shape that is not repeated in the grid. Let's examine the options:

- **A:** Pentagon
- **B:** Hexagon
- **C:** Square
- **D:** Circle
- **E:** Triangle
- **F:** Pentagon

The shapes in the grid include a Circle, Hexagon, Square, Pentagon, and Triangle. The Pentagon appears twice in the grid, and the Hexagon appears twice as well. The Triangle and Square appear once each. The Circle appears once.

Since the pattern requires each box to contain a unique shape, the correct answer should be a shape that is not repeated in the grid. The Circle (D) is the only shape that fits this criterion.

### Identifying the Pattern:
- The pattern alternates shapes between two types in each row and column.
- The first column has triangles, the second column has hexagons, and the third column alternates between diamonds and hexagons.

### Filling the Empty Box:
- The empty box is in the third column and second row.
- The shape above it in the third column is a hexagon.
- The shape below it in the third column is a diamond.
- Therefore, the shape in the empty box should be a hexagon to maintain the alternating pattern.

3. Top-right box: Contains a pentagon and a circle.
4. Middle-left box: Contains a triangle and a circle.
5. Middle-middle box: Contains a hexagon with three circles inside.
6. Middle-right box: Contains a hexagon with four circles inside.
7. Bottom-left box: Contains a hexagon with two circles inside.
8. Bottom-middle box: Contains a hexagon with three circles inside.
9. Bottom-right box: Contains a hexagon with four circles inside.

Now, let's look at the options A to F:

- A: Contains three triangles.
- B: Contains three triangles.
- C: Contains two circles.
- D: Contains one triangle.
- E: Contains two circles.
- F: Contains four circles.

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify a pattern that consistently relates the shapes in the boxes. One possible pattern could be the number of circles in the hexagons. Let's examine the number of circles in the hexagons:

- Top-right box: 1 circle
- Middle-middle box: 3 circles
- Middle-right box: 4 circles
- Bottom-left box: 2 circles
- Bottom-middle box: 3 circles
- Bottom-right box: 4 circles

The pattern seems to be that the number of circles in the hexagons increases by one as we move from left to right and top to bottom. Therefore, the empty box (bottom-right) should contain a hexagon with 5 circles.

Option F contains four circles, which does not match the pattern. Therefore, the correct answer must be the one that fits the pattern of increasing the number of circles.

- **D**: Pentagon with a triangle and a triangle inside.
- **E**: Pentagon with a triangle and a circle inside.
- **F**: Pentagon with a square and a circle inside.

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern that continues the sequence in the bottom row. The bottom row has pentagons with a triangle, a square, and a circle inside them. The sequence appears to follow a rotation or a specific order of symbols.

Given the sequence in the bottom row:
- First pentagon: Triangle inside.
