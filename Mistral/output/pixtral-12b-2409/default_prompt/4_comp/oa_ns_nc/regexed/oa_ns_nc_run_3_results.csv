1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a large triangle, a pentagon, and a large circle.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a small triangle, a small pentagon, and a small circle.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are an empty triangle, a pentagon, and an 'X'.

The pattern seems to involve alternating between different shapes and sizes. Let's look at the options provided (A to F) and see which one fits the pattern:

- **A**: A black filled triangle pointing downwards.
- **B**: An empty triangle pointing downwards.
- **C**: A black filled circle.
- **D**: A larger black filled circle.
- **E**: An empty triangle pointing upwards.
- **F**: An empty circle.
- **G**: A black filled triangle pointing upwards.
- **H**: An empty circle.

The pattern alternates between different shapes and sizes. The empty box in the grid is in the third row, second column. The shape in the same column in the first row is a pentagon, and in the second row, it is a small pentagon. The third row has an 'X'.

Given this, the correct shape to fill the empty box should follow the pattern of alternating shapes and sizes. The empty triangle pointing downwards (B) fits this pattern as it alternates with the pentagon and 'X'.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

From this analysis, we can see that the pattern alternates between shapes in each row and column. Specifically, the shapes in the first column are pentagons and circles, the second column is triangles and circles, and the third column is diamonds and triangles.

Given that the empty box is in the third column and the second row, we need to find a shape that fits the pattern. The third column alternates between diamonds and triangles, and the second row alternates between pentagons, circles, triangles, and smaller diamonds.

To fill the empty box, we need a shape that fits the pattern of the third column and the second row. The third column has diamonds and triangles, and the second row has pentagons, circles, triangles, and smaller diamonds. The correct shape should be a triangle, as it fits the pattern of alternating between diamonds and triangles in the third column.
