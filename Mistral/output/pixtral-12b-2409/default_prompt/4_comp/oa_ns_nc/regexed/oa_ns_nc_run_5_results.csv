0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_ns_nc_center_single_RAVEN_9930_train.png,H,E,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid row by row.

1. **First Row:**
   - Shapes: Triangle (gray), Pentagon (gray), Circle (gray)
   - Observation: All shapes are filled with gray color.

2. **Second Row:**
   - Shapes: Triangle (white), Pentagon (white), Circle (gray)
   - Observation: The first two shapes are white, and the third shape is gray.

3. **Third Row:**
   - Shapes: Triangle (white), Pentagon (white), Cross (gray)
   - Observation: The first two shapes are white, and the third shape is gray.

From this analysis, we can infer that the pattern alternates between two white shapes and one gray shape in each row.

Next, we need to determine the pattern of shapes themselves. The shapes in the first column are:
   - First Row: Triangle (gray)
   - Second Row: Triangle (white)
   - Third Row: Triangle (white)

The shapes in the second column are:
   - First Row: Pentagon (gray)
   - Second Row: Pentagon (white)
   - Third Row: Pentagon (white)

The shapes in the third column are:
   - First Row: Circle (gray)
   - Second Row: Circle (gray)
   - Third Row: Cross (gray)

The pattern for the shapes seems to be alternating between triangles and pentagons in the first two columns, and then a different shape (circle or cross) in the third column.

Given the empty box is in the third column and second row, we need a gray shape. The options available are:
   - A: Black Triangle
   - B: White Triangle
   - C: Black Circle
   - D: Black Circle
   - E: White Circle
   - F: Black Triangle

Considering the pattern, the correct shape should be a gray circle.

The correct answer is: **E**

   - Shape 3: Triangle with a triangle inside.

2. **Second Row:**
   - Shape 1: Circle with a circle inside.
   - Shape 2: Pentagon with a triangle inside.

- **Option B:** Pentagon with a circle inside.
- **Option C:** Pentagon with a filled circle inside.
- **Option D:** Pentagon with a filled circle inside.
- **Option E:** Pentagon with a filled circle inside.
- **Option F:** Pentagon with a filled circle inside.

The pattern seems to involve shapes with different internal figures. The first row has a mix of different internal shapes, while the second row continues this pattern. The third row starts with a circle with a triangle inside and a pentagon with a hexagon inside. The empty box in the first column of the third row should follow the pattern of having a circle with a triangle inside.

Upon closer inspection, we notice that the shapes alternate between triangles, squares, and circles. The empty box is in the middle row, third column. The shape to the left of the empty box is a triangle, and the shape above it is a square. Following the pattern, the shape below it should be a circle.

Since none of the options (A to F) match the pattern of a circle, we need to look for another pattern. The shapes in the grid also have a smaller shape inside them. The smaller shapes are squares, diamonds, and pentagons. The pattern might involve the smaller shapes as well.

1. Top row: Circle with square, Circle with dot, Circle with small circle.
2. Middle row: Pentagon with dot, Pentagon with small circle, Pentagon with dot.
3. Bottom row: Pentagon with triangle, Pentagon with square, Pentagon with two dots.

First, let's look at the shapes in the top row:
- Circle with square
- Circle with dot
- Circle with small circle

Next, let's look at the shapes in the middle row:
- Pentagon with dot
- Pentagon with small circle
- Pentagon with dot

Finally, let's look at the shapes in the bottom row:
- Pentagon with triangle
- Pentagon with square
- Pentagon with two dots

Now, let's identify the pattern:
- The top row shapes are all circles with different fillings.
- The middle row shapes are all pentagons with different fillings.
- The bottom row shapes are all pentagons with different fillings.

The pattern seems to be that each row has a different type of shape, and the filling of the shapes changes within each row.

Given this pattern, the empty box in the grid should have a pentagon shape with a specific filling that matches the pattern in the middle row.

Looking at the options:
- A: Pentagon with dot
- B: Pentagon with small circle
- C: Pentagon with dot
- D: Pentagon with small circle
- E: Pentagon with dot
- F: Pentagon with small circle

The middle row has alternating pentagons with a dot and a small circle. Therefore, the correct answer should follow this pattern.

Since the middle row has a pentagon with a small circle and a pentagon with a dot, the correct answer should be a pentagon with a small circle.

The correct answer is: D.
