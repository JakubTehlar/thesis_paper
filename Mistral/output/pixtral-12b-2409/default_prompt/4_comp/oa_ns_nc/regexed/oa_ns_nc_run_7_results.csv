0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_ns_nc_center_single_RAVEN_9930_train.png,H,E,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the pattern in the 3x3 grid. The shapes in the grid are arranged in a specific sequence, and we need to identify the rule governing this sequence.

Let's examine the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: Large triangle, large pentagon, large circle
2. Middle row: Small triangle, small pentagon, small circle
3. Bottom row: Hollow triangle, hollow pentagon, cross

Now, let's look at the options provided:

A. Black filled triangle
B. Hollow triangle
C. Black filled circle
D. Black filled large circle
E. Hollow circle
F. Black filled inverted triangle

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes. One possible pattern could be the size of the shapes. The top row contains large shapes, the middle row contains small shapes, and the bottom row contains hollow shapes. The empty box is in the bottom row, which suggests it should be a hollow shape.

Among the options, the hollow shapes are B (hollow triangle) and E (hollow circle). Since the bottom row already has a hollow triangle, the next hollow shape in the sequence would be a hollow circle.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is: E

1,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_ns_nc_in_center_single_out_center_single_RAVEN_9933_train.png,D,F,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. Top row: Circle with a hexagon, pentagon with a circle, triangle with a triangle.
2. Middle row: Circle with a circle, pentagon with a triangle, triangle with a hexagon.
3. Bottom row: Circle with a triangle, pentagon with a hexagon, cross mark.

To find the pattern, we need to look at the relationship between the shapes in each box. One possible pattern could be the transformation of shapes from one box to the next. Let's examine the shapes in the rows:

- From the first to the second row:
  - Circle with a hexagon → Pentagon with a circle → Triangle with a triangle.
  - Circle with a circle → Pentagon with a triangle → Triangle with a hexagon.
  - Circle with a triangle → Pentagon with a hexagon → Cross mark.

- From the second to the third row:
  - Pentagon with a circle → Circle with a circle → Circle with a triangle.
  - Pentagon with a triangle → Triangle with a hexagon → Pentagon with a hexagon.
  - Triangle with a triangle → Cross mark → (No corresponding shape).

Given the pattern, we need to find a shape that fits the sequence. The empty box is in the third row, second column. The shape to the left of this box is a pentagon with a hexagon. The shape to the right of this box is a pentagon with a hexagon. Therefore, the shape that should be in the empty box should follow the pattern of the pentagon with a hexagon.

The correct answer is: **F**."

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern that consistently connects the shapes in the grid. Observing the grid, we notice that each row contains a mix of different shapes. The pattern seems to involve alternating between different shapes.

Given this, the correct option should contain a mix of different shapes, similar to the arrangement in the grid.

- **Option C**: One circle, one square, one diamond.
- **Option D**: One circle, one square, one inverted triangle.
- **Option E**: One circle, one square, one diamond.

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify a pattern that could connect the shapes in the grid. One possible pattern could be the transformation of shapes from gray to white or from filled to outlined.

Let's analyze the options:
- A: Hexagon (white outline) - This matches the hexagon in the top-left corner.
- B: Irregular pentagon (white outline) - This matches the irregular pentagon in the top-middle.
- C: Dark hexagon - This does not match any shape in the grid.
- D: Dark hexagon - This does not match any shape in the grid.
- E: Dark hexagon - This does not match any shape in the grid.

A. Diamond with a square inside
B. Diamond with a square inside
C. Diamond with a square inside
D. Diamond with a square inside
E. Diamond with a square inside
F. Diamond with a square inside

The pattern in the 3x3 grid involves alternating shapes and their positions. The shapes in the grid are Triangle, Diamond, Circle, Square, Circle, Triangle, and Square. The pattern alternates between different shapes and their positions.

Given the options, all of them are diamonds with a square inside. This suggests that the pattern might be related to the position of the shapes rather than their type.

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify which position in the grid the diamond with a square inside would fit best. The empty box is in the middle row, third column. This position currently has a Triangle.

The pattern in the middle row is Circle, Triangle, Square. If we replace the Triangle with a Diamond, the sequence would be Circle, Diamond, Square. This fits the pattern of alternating shapes.

Therefore, the correct answer is a diamond with a square inside, which matches option A.

   - The middle row has a diamond, a pentagon, and a hexagon.
   - The bottom row has a hexagon and a question mark (?).

2. **Analyze the shapes in the columns:**
   - The first column has a triangle and a diamond.
   - The second column has a diamond and a pentagon.
   - The third column has a pentagon and a hexagon.

3. **Look for patterns in the rows and columns:**
   - The first row shows a progression from a triangle to a diamond to a pentagon.
   - The second row shows a progression from a diamond to a pentagon to a hexagon.
   - The third row shows a progression from a hexagon to a question mark (?).

4. **Determine the pattern in the rows and columns:**

   - The first column shows a progression from a triangle to a diamond.
   - The second column shows a progression from a diamond to a pentagon.
   - The third column shows a progression from a pentagon to a hexagon.

5. **Identify the missing shape:**

[ Circle with square ] [ Circle with dot ] [ Circle with triangle ]
[ Pentagon with dot ] [ Pentagon with dot ] [ Pentagon with dot ]
[ Pentagon with triangle ] [ Pentagon with square ] [ X ]

Let's break down the pattern:
1. The first row has three circles with different symbols inside.
2. The second row has three pentagons with dots inside.
3. The third row has a mix of shapes and symbols: a pentagon with a triangle, a pentagon with a square, and an 'X'.

To determine the correct shape for the empty box, we need to identify the pattern that links the shapes and symbols together. The key is to look at the progression of shapes and symbols from left to right and top to bottom.

Observing the pattern:
- The first row has circles with different symbols.
- The second row has pentagons with dots.
- The third row has a mix of shapes and symbols.

Given the progression, the empty box should follow the pattern of the third row, which mixes shapes and symbols. The shape directly to the left of the empty box is a pentagon with a triangle. Therefore, the empty box should contain a pentagon with a symbol that matches the pattern.

The correct answer is a pentagon with a dot, which matches the pattern of the second row.
