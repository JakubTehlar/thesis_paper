**Pattern Analysis**:
- The pattern seems to involve filled shapes in the first row and the third column.
- The second column has empty shapes in the middle row.
- The first column has filled shapes in the top row and empty shapes in the middle row.

Given this, the correct shape to fill the empty box in the middle left of the second row should be an empty triangle (B), matching the pattern of empty shapes in the middle row of the first column.

The correct answer is: B"

1. Top row: Circle with a hexagon, pentagon with a circle, triangle with a triangle.
2. Middle row: Circle with a circle, pentagon with a triangle, triangle with a hexagon.
3. Bottom row: Circle with a triangle, pentagon with a hexagon, cross mark.

The pattern seems to involve a combination of shapes where one shape is inside another. We need to determine which shape fits this pattern.

Let's look at the options A to F:

- A: Triangle with a triangle inside.
- B: Triangle with a circle inside.
- C: Triangle with a filled circle inside.
- D: Triangle with a filled square inside.
- E: Triangle with a smaller triangle inside.
- F: Triangle with a filled triangle inside.

Given the pattern in the grid, the shapes inside the larger shapes vary, and the larger shape is consistently a triangle. The pattern involves different shapes inside the triangle. The correct answer should follow this pattern.

The correct answer is: E"

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a diamond, a square, and an inverted triangle.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a square, a diamond, and a circle.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a circle, a square, and an inverted triangle.

Next, we need to look at the options provided (A to F) and determine which one fits the pattern:

- **Option A**: Three circles.
- **Option B**: Three squares.
- **Option C**: One circle, one square, and one diamond.
- **Option D**: One circle, one square, and one inverted triangle.
- **Option E**: One circle, one square, and one diamond.
- **Option F**: One circle, one square, and one inverted triangle.

From the grid, we can see that the shapes alternate between circles, squares, and inverted triangles. The empty box in the grid is located in the bottom row, which currently has a circle, a square, and an inverted triangle. Following the pattern, the next shape should be a circle.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

4,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_ns_nc_distribute_four_RAVEN_9763_train.png,E,A,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each row and column:

1. **First Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a diamond.
2. **Second Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a diamond.
3. **Third Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a diamond.

Now, let's look at the columns:

1. **First Column**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a circle.
2. **Second Column**: The shapes are a hexagon, a diamond, and a hexagon.
3. **Third Column**: The shapes are a diamond, a circle, and a diamond.

1. **First Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a diamond.
2. **Second Diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)**: The shapes are a diamond, a hexagon, and a circle.

From this analysis, we can see that the pattern alternates between circles, hexagons, and diamonds. To fill the empty box, we need to determine the shape that completes this pattern.

Given the empty box is in the third row and third column, we need to find the shape that fits the pattern of alternating circles, hexagons, and diamonds. The previous shape in the third column was a diamond, so the next shape should be a circle.

Therefore, the correct answer is a circle.

6,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_ns_nc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9929_test.png,E,B,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the pattern in the 3x3 grid. The shapes in the grid include squares, diamonds, and hexagons, each in different shades of gray. The goal is to identify the rule governing the arrangement of these shapes.

1. **Identify the shapes and their positions:**
   - Top row: Square, Hexagon, Diamond
   - Middle row: Diamond, Square, Hexagon
   - Bottom row: Hexagon, Diamond, Square

2. **Analyze the pattern:**
   - The shapes alternate between rows. For example, the top row starts with a Square, Hexagon, and Diamond. The middle row starts with a Diamond, Square, and Hexagon.
   - The shading of the shapes also alternates. For example, the top row has a light Square, dark Hexagon, and light Diamond.

3. **Determine the correct shape for the empty box:**
   - The empty box is in the bottom row, third column.
   - Following the pattern, the third column should have a Square.
   - The shading alternates, so the Square in the third column should be dark.

4. **Match the shape from the options:**
   - Option A: Light Square
   - Option B: Dark Square
   - Option C: Light Hexagon
   - Option D: Dark Hexagon
   - Option E: Light Diamond
   - Option F: Dark Diamond

   The correct shape is a dark Square, which matches Option B.

7,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/oa_ns_nc_center_single_RAVEN_9917_val.png,B,C,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: Hexagon, irregular pentagon, small square
2. Middle row: Small pentagon, diamond, triangle
3. Bottom row: Circle, small hexagon, cross

Next, we examine the options provided:

A. Hexagon
B. Irregular pentagon
C. Black irregular pentagon
D. Black hexagon
E. Black irregular pentagon
F. Black irregular pentagon

The pattern in the grid involves alternating between different shapes and colors. The shapes vary in form and color, but the key is to identify the consistent transformation from one shape to another.

Looking at the grid, the shapes transition from a hexagon to an irregular pentagon to a small square, then to a small pentagon to a diamond to a triangle, and finally to a circle to a small hexagon to a cross.

Given this pattern, the empty box should follow the sequence of transformations. The empty box is in the bottom row, which currently has a circle, small hexagon, and cross. The pattern suggests a transition from the small hexagon to a shape that is neither a circle nor a cross.

Among the options, the black irregular pentagon (C, E, F) fits the pattern of alternating shapes and colors. The black irregular pentagon is a logical choice to maintain the pattern of alternating shapes and colors.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is: C"

   - Box 2: A square with three circles inside
   - Box 3: A pentagon with three circles inside

3. Bottom row:
   - Box 1: A triangle inside a square
   - Box 2: A square with three circles inside
   - Box 3: A pentagon with three circles inside

Now, let's look at the options A to F:

- A: Three triangles inside a circle
- B: Three triangles inside a circle
- C: Three circles inside a square
- D: One triangle inside a circle
- E: Three circles inside a circle
- F: Three circles inside a circle

The pattern seems to involve shapes with three circles inside them. Observing the grid, the shapes with three circles inside are:

- Box 2 (Top row): Square with three circles
- Box 2 (Middle row): Square with three circles
- Box 2 (Bottom row): Square with three circles

This suggests that the correct answer should be a shape with three circles inside it. Among the options, C, E, and F fit this description. However, the pattern in the grid alternates between squares and pentagons, which both contain three circles. Therefore, the correct answer should be a square with three circles inside, which is option C.
