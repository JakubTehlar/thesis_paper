1,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_ns_nc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9439_test.png,B,E,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the patterns in the shapes within the 3x3 grid. The shapes vary in form (circle, triangle, hexagon) and color (gray, white), and they also vary in size (small, medium, large).

Here are the steps to identify the correct pattern:

1. **Identify the shapes in each row and column:**
   - Row 1: Circle, Triangle, Hexagon
   - Row 2: Circle, Triangle, Hexagon
   - Row 3: Circle, Triangle, Hexagon

2. **Identify the colors in each row and column:**
   - Row 1: Gray, White, Gray
   - Row 2: White, Gray, White
   - Row 3: Gray, White, Gray

3. **Identify the sizes in each row and column:**
   - Row 1: Small, Medium, Large
   - Row 2: Large, Small, Medium
   - Row 3: Medium, Large, Small

4. **Determine the pattern:**
   - The pattern alternates between gray and white in each row.
   - The pattern alternates between small, medium, and large in each row.
   - The shapes alternate between circle, triangle, and hexagon in each row.

Given these observations, we need to find the shape that fits the pattern for the empty box.

5. **Analyze the empty box:**
   - The empty box is in the third column and second row.
   - The second row has alternating colors: White, Gray, White.
   - The second row has alternating sizes: Large, Small, Medium.
   - The second row has alternating shapes: Circle, Triangle, Hexagon.

6. **Determine the correct shape:**
   - The second row's second column has a white, small, triangle.
   - Therefore, the third column should have a gray, medium, circle.

Thus, the correct answer is a gray, medium circle.

The correct answer is: E"

1. **Identify the Shapes**: The shapes in the grid are circles, pentagons, and triangles.
2. **Analyze the Pattern**: The shapes are arranged in a specific order in each row and column.
3. **Determine the Rule**: We need to find the rule that governs the arrangement of the shapes.
