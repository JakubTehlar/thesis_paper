0,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_oc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9869_test.png,D,H,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a pentagon, and a hexagon.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a pentagon, and a hexagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a pentagon, and a hexagon.

The pattern seems to be a progression from left to right, where each shape changes from a triangle to a pentagon to a hexagon. This pattern repeats in each row.

Given this pattern, the correct shape to fill the empty box should follow the same sequence:
- The first box in each row has a triangle.
- The second box in each row has a pentagon.
- The third box in each row has a hexagon.

Since the empty box is in the third column, it should contain a hexagon.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Next, let's look at the shapes inside each box:

1. Top row:
   - Box 1: One diamond
   - Box 2: One triangle
   - Box 3: Two diamonds

2. Middle row:
   - Box 4: Two diamonds, one square
