### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows and Columns:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes are different in terms of color and orientation. There is no clear pattern in this row.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes are more consistent in terms of color and orientation. They seem to be rotated versions of each other.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are again consistent in color and orientation, appearing to be rotated versions of each other.

2. **Analyze the Diagonals:**
   - **Main Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):** The shapes are consistent in color and orientation, appearing to be rotated versions of each other.
   - **Secondary Diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):** The shapes are consistent in color and orientation, appearing to be rotated versions of each other.

3. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - The consistent pattern across the rows and diagonals is rotation. Each shape in the second and third rows is a rotated version of the shape in the first row.

4. **Determine the Shape for the Empty Box:**
   - To find the correct shape for the empty box, we need to determine the next rotation in the sequence.
   - The shapes in the first row are: black hexagon, black hexagon, gray hexagon.
   - The shapes in the second row are: black hexagon, gray hexagon, black hexagon.
   - The shapes in the third row are: gray hexagon, black hexagon, gray hexagon.
   - The main diagonal shapes are: black hexagon, gray hexagon, black hexagon.
   - The secondary diagonal shapes are: black hexagon, gray hexagon, black hexagon.

5. **Match the Pattern:**
   - The pattern of rotation suggests that the next shape in the sequence should be a rotated version of the shape directly above it in the first row.
   - The shape directly above the empty box in the first row is a gray hexagon.
   - Rotating a gray hexagon 90 degrees clockwise gives us a black hexagon.
