   - **Top-right to Bottom-left Diagonal:** The shapes change from a filled square to a triangle to a hexagon.

4. **Identify the Patterns:**
   - **Shape Transformation:** There is a consistent transformation from simpler shapes to more complex shapes.
   - **Color Change:** There is a shift from lighter to darker shades.
   - **Filling:** The shapes become more filled or solid as we move from left to right and top to bottom.

5. **Analyze the Empty Box:**
   - The empty box is in the third row and third column, which corresponds to the position of a cross in the third column.
   - The previous shape in the third column is a filled hexagon, suggesting a transition to a more filled shape.

6. **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**
   - Options A, B, C, D, and E do not match the pattern of becoming more filled or solid.
   - Options F and G are hexagons, which do not fit the pattern of becoming a cross.

7. **Select the Correct Answer:**
   - Option H is a filled square, which fits the pattern of becoming more filled.
