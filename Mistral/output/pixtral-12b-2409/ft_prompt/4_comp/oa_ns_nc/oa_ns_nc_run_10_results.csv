1. **First Row**:
   - Top-left: Filled triangle (gray)
   - Top-middle: Filled pentagon (gray)
   - Top-right: Filled circle (gray)

2. **Second Row**:
   - Middle-left: Empty triangle
   - Middle-middle: Empty pentagon
   - Middle-right: Filled circle (gray)

3. **Third Row**:
   - Bottom-left: Empty triangle
   - Bottom-middle: Empty pentagon
   - Bottom-right: Empty cross

4. **Options**:
   - A: Filled inverted triangle (black)
   - B: Empty inverted triangle
   - C: Filled circle (black)
   - D: Filled circle (black)
   - E: Empty circle
   - F: Filled inverted triangle (black)

**Pattern Analysis**:
- The shapes in the first row are all filled shapes (gray).
- The shapes in the second row have an empty triangle and pentagon, followed by a filled circle.
- The third row has an empty triangle and pentagon, followed by an empty cross.

The pattern seems to alternate between filled and empty shapes. Specifically, the filled shapes in the first row correspond to filled shapes in the second row, and the empty shapes in the second row correspond to empty shapes in the third row.

Given this pattern, the empty box in the third row should be filled with a shape that matches the filled shape in the second row. The second row has a filled circle (gray), so the empty box should be filled with a filled circle.

**Conclusion**:
The correct answer is: E"

2. Middle row: Circle with a circle, pentagon with a triangle, triangle with a hexagon.
3. Bottom row: Circle with a triangle, pentagon with a hexagon, cross mark.

The pattern seems to involve a combination of shapes within different geometric figures. Let's look at the options provided (A to F) and see which one fits the pattern:

- **A**: Triangle with a pentagon.
- **B**: Triangle with a circle.
- **C**: Triangle with a filled circle.
- **D**: Triangle with a gray circle.
- **E**: Triangle with a small circle.
- **F**: Triangle with a filled gray circle.

Given the pattern in the grid, the shapes within the triangles vary in type and filling. The triangles in the grid contain different shapes such as circles, hexagons, and pentagons. The correct answer should follow this pattern.

- **Option D**: One black circle, one black square, one black diamond
- **Option E**: One black circle, one black square, one black triangle
- **Option F**: One black circle, one black square, one black diamond

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The shapes alternate between different types (circle, square, triangle, diamond) in each row. The pattern seems to alternate between different shapes without a specific sequence.

Given this, the correct answer should match the pattern in the grid. The shapes in the grid include circles, squares, triangles, and diamonds. The pattern does not follow a strict sequence but alternates between these shapes.

Based on the options provided, **Option E** matches the pattern in the grid as it includes one black circle, one black square, and one black triangle, which are all present in the grid.

2. **Second Column**: The shapes are a hexagon, a hexagon, and a hexagon.
3. **Third Column**: The shapes are a diamond, a diamond, and a diamond.

From this analysis, we can see that each column contains only one type of shape. Therefore, the pattern is that each column must contain the same shape throughout.

Given that the empty box is in the third column, the correct shape to fill the empty box must be a diamond.

The correct answer is: **H**."

- The pattern seems to involve alternating between triangles and pentagons in the first column and having all pentagons in the second and third columns.
- The empty box is in the third column and the third row.

### Filling the Empty Box:
- Since the third column has all pentagons, and the third row also has pentagons, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a pentagon.

3. Top-right: Small square (gray)
4. Middle-left: Small pentagon (gray)
5. Middle-middle: Diamond (gray)
6. Middle-right: Triangle (gray)
7. Bottom-left: Circle (white)
8. Bottom-middle: Small hexagon (white)
9. Bottom-right: Cross (X)

Now, let's examine the options provided:

A. Hexagon (white outline)
B. Irregular pentagon (white outline)
C. Dark pentagon
D. Dark hexagon
E. Dark pentagon
F. Dark pentagon
G. White pentagon
H. White hexagon

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the shapes' properties such as color, shape type, and shading. The grid has a mix of gray and white shapes, and the shapes vary in type (hexagon, pentagon, square, circle, diamond, triangle, and cross).

Given the variety of shapes and colors, the pattern might be based on the alternation of shapes or colors. However, the grid does not show a clear alternation pattern based on color or shape type. Therefore, the pattern might be more complex or based on a different property.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the pattern might be based on the alternation of filled and unfilled shapes. The grid has alternating filled (gray) and unfilled (white) shapes. This pattern alternates between filled and unfilled shapes.

Since the empty box is unfilled (white), the correct shape to fill the box should be an unfilled shape. Among the options, the unfilled shapes are:

A. Hexagon (white outline)
B. Irregular pentagon (white outline)
G. White pentagon
H. White hexagon

Given the pattern of alternating filled and unfilled shapes, the correct answer should be an unfilled shape. The options A, B, G, and H are all unfilled shapes. However, the pattern does not specify a particular shape type, only the color.

Therefore, the correct answer is any of the unfilled shapes. Since the empty box is a white cross (X), the most logical choice would be:

The correct answer is: H

A. Diamond with a square inside
B. Diamond with a square inside
C. Diamond with a square inside
D. Diamond with a square inside
E. Diamond with a square inside
F. Diamond with a square inside

Upon examining the shapes in the grid, we notice that the shapes are varied and do not follow a simple geometric pattern. However, the central theme seems to be the presence of a small shape inside a larger shape. The shapes in the grid include:

- Triangle with a small triangle inside
- Diamond with a small square inside
- Circle with a small pentagon inside
- Square with a small diamond inside
- Circle with a small pentagon inside
- Triangle with a small triangle inside
- Circle with a small pentagon inside
- Triangle with a small triangle inside
- Square with a small diamond inside

Given this, the pattern seems to be the presence of a small shape inside a larger shape. Among the options, all shapes are diamonds with a square inside. This fits the pattern of having a small shape inside a larger shape.

9. **Sixth Column:**
   - Shapes: Large Hexagon, Large Circle, Large Hexagon
   - Pattern: The shapes are different in each box.

Given the complexity and variety of shapes, it appears that the pattern might be based on the type of shape rather than a specific transformation. Let's look at the options:

- **A:** Large Hexagon
- **B:** Hexagon
- **C:** Square
- **D:** Small Circle
- **E:** Large Hexagon
- **F:** Hexagon

Since the empty box is in the third row and third column, we need to determine which shape would fit best. Observing the third row, the shapes are Large Circle, Large Hexagon, and Cross. Given that the Large Hexagon appears twice in the third row, it seems logical to fill the empty box with a shape that fits this pattern.

The shapes in the first row are all circles with different internal shapes. The second row features pentagons with different internal shapes. The third row has pentagons with different internal shapes and a cross mark.
