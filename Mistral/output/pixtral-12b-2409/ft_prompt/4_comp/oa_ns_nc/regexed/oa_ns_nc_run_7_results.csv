1. **Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes are a triangle, a pentagon, and a circle. There is no clear transformation from one shape to another.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes are a smaller triangle, a smaller pentagon, and a smaller circle. Again, no clear transformation.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are an empty triangle, a pentagon, and an ""X"" symbol.

2. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - **Shape Changes:** There doesn't seem to be a consistent shape change across rows or columns.
   - **Rotation:** The shapes do not appear to be rotating.
   - **Color Shades:** The shapes are in black and white, but there is no consistent color change.
   - **Element Counting:** The number of sides or elements in the shapes does not follow a pattern.

3. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The shapes are different geometric figures (triangle, pentagon, circle).
   - The sizes of the shapes decrease from the first row to the second row.
   - The third row has an empty triangle and an ""X"" symbol.

4. **Eliminate Options:**
   - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are provided below the matrix.
   - Based on the observed patterns, we need to find a shape that fits the context of the third row.

5. **Select the Correct Shape:**
   - The third row has an empty triangle and an ""X"" symbol. The ""X"" symbol could indicate an absence or a placeholder.
   - The correct answer should be a shape that logically fits this context.

Given the unique features and the absence of a clear pattern, the ""X"" symbol might represent an absence or a placeholder. Therefore, the correct answer should be a shape that logically fits this context.

**Conclusion:**
The correct answer is: **H**."

3. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - **Shape Changes:** There doesn't seem to be a consistent change in shape across rows, columns, or diagonals.
   - **Color Shades:** The shapes are monochrome, so color is not a factor.
   - **Element Counting:** The number of shapes in each row and column is consistent, but this does not provide a clear pattern.

4. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The shapes are varied and do not follow a consistent transformation pattern.

5. **Eliminate Options:**
   - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H need to be examined to see which one fits the pattern.
