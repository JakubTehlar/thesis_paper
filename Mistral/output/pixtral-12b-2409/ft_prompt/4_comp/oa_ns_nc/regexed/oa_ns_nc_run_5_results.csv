   - **Color Change:** The color of the shapes changes from light gray to black.
   - **Filling:** Some shapes are filled, while others are not.

3. **Analyze the Sequence:**
   - From left to right, the shapes seem to follow a sequence of transformations:
     - The first shape is a filled hexagon.
     - The second shape is a filled pentagon.
     - The third shape is a filled triangle.
     - The fourth shape is an empty hexagon.
     - The fifth shape is an empty pentagon.
     - The sixth shape is an empty triangle.

4. **Determine the Rule:**
   - The shapes are transformed from filled to empty.
   - The shapes are transformed from hexagons to pentagons to triangles.
   - The color changes from light gray to black.

5. **Apply the Rule to the Empty Box:**
