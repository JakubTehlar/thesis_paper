",False,"To solve this IQ test question, we need to carefully analyze the patterns in the 3x3 grid of shapes. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes are a triangle, a pentagon, and a circle. There is no clear transformation from one shape to another.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes are a smaller triangle, a smaller pentagon, and a smaller circle. Again, no clear transformation.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are an empty triangle, a pentagon, and an ""X"" symbol.

2. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - **Shape Changes:** There are no consistent shape changes across rows or columns.
   - **Rotations:** The shapes do not seem to rotate consistently.
   - **Color Shades:** The shapes do not show any consistent color changes.
   - **Element Counting:** The shapes do not change in the number of sides or elements.

3. **Identify Unique Features in the Shapes:**
   - The shapes are different in type (triangle, pentagon, circle).
   - The sizes of the shapes decrease from the first row to the second row.
   - The third row has an empty triangle and an ""X"" symbol.

4. **Eliminate Options (A to H) That Clearly Do Not Match the Observed Patterns:**
   - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are all different shapes and sizes.
   - Since the third row has an ""X"" symbol, we need to find a shape that fits the pattern of the third row.

5. **Select the Correct Shape That Completes the Pattern:**
   - The third row has an ""X"" symbol, which does not correspond to any of the shapes in the first two rows.
   - Therefore, the correct answer should be the ""X"" symbol.

**Conclusion:**
The correct answer is: X.
