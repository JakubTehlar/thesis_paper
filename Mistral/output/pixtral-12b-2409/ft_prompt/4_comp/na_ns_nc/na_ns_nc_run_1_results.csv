",False,"To solve this IQ test question, we need to carefully analyze the patterns in the 3x3 grid and deduce the correct shape for the empty box marked with an 'x'.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes vary in type and color. There is no clear pattern in terms of shape transformation.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes are more uniform in type (hexagons) but vary in color and size.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are again varied, with no clear transformation pattern.

2. **Observe the Changes Across Columns:**
   - **First Column:** The shapes vary in type and color. There is no clear pattern.
   - **Second Column:** The shapes are primarily hexagons, with variations in color and size.
   - **Third Column:** The shapes are varied, with no clear transformation pattern.

3. **Observe the Diagonals:**
   - **First Diagonal:** The shapes are varied, with no clear pattern.
   - **Second Diagonal:** The shapes are primarily hexagons, with variations in color and size.
   - **Third Diagonal:** The shapes are varied, with no clear pattern.

4. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The second row and second diagonal have a consistent pattern of hexagons.
   - The hexagons in the second row and second diagonal vary in color and size.

5. **Determine the Pattern:**
   - The consistent pattern appears to be the use of hexagons in the second row and second diagonal.
   - The hexagons vary in color and size, suggesting a possible rotation or shading pattern.

6. **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**
   - Options that do not feature hexagons can be eliminated.
   - Options that do not follow the color and size variations of the hexagons can be eliminated.

### Conclusion:
Based on the observed patterns, the correct answer should be a hexagon that follows the color and size variations seen in the second row and second diagonal.
