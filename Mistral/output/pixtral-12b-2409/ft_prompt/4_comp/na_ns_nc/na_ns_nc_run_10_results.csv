",False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each cell:

1. Top-left cell: Hexagon
2. Top-middle cell: Square
3. Top-right cell: Large circle
4. Middle-left cell: Pentagon
5. Middle-middle cell: Triangle
6. Middle-right cell: Small circle
7. Bottom-left cell: Hexagon
8. Bottom-middle cell: Hexagon
9. Bottom-right cell: Hexagon

Now, let's examine the shapes in the bottom row:
- Bottom-left cell: Hexagon
- Bottom-middle cell: Hexagon
- Bottom-right cell: Hexagon

The pattern in the bottom row is that all the shapes are hexagons.

Next, let's look at the shapes in the middle row:
- Middle-left cell: Pentagon
- Middle-middle cell: Triangle
- Middle-right cell: Small circle

The pattern in the middle row is that the shapes are different polygons and a circle, but they are not consistent.

Finally, let's examine the shapes in the top row:
- Top-left cell: Hexagon
- Top-middle cell: Square
- Top-right cell: Large circle

The pattern in the top row is that the shapes are different polygons and a circle, but they are not consistent.

Given that the bottom row has a consistent pattern of hexagons, we can infer that the missing shape should be a hexagon.

The correct answer is: **Hexagon (A)**.

The correct answer is: A."

",False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each row and column:

1. **First Row**: The shapes are a square, a diamond, and a circle.
2. **Second Row**: The shapes are a diamond, a circle, and a pentagon.
3. **Third Row**: The shapes are a pentagon, a hexagon, and a cross.

Next, let's look at the columns:

1. **First Column**: The shapes are a square, a diamond, and a pentagon.
2. **Second Column**: The shapes are a diamond, a circle, and a hexagon.
3. **Third Column**: The shapes are a circle, a pentagon, and a hexagon.

Now, let's examine the shapes in the rows and columns to find a consistent pattern:

- **First Row**: Square, Diamond, Circle
- **Second Row**: Diamond, Circle, Pentagon
- **Third Row**: Pentagon, Hexagon, Cross

- **First Column**: Square, Diamond, Pentagon
- **Second Column**: Diamond, Circle, Hexagon
- **Third Column**: Circle, Pentagon, Hexagon

From this analysis, we can see that the shapes are changing in a systematic way. The pattern seems to involve alternating between different shapes, possibly based on their geometric properties or their number of sides.

Given the options (A to F), we need to find a shape that fits the pattern in the empty box. The empty box is in the third row and third column. The shapes in the third row are Pentagon, Hexagon, and Cross. The shapes in the third column are Circle, Pentagon, and Hexagon.

To determine the correct shape, we need to look at the transition from the second row to the third row and from the second column to the third column. The transition from the second row to the third row goes from Circle to Pentagon to Hexagon. The transition from the second column to the third column goes from Circle to Pentagon to Hexagon.

Given these transitions, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a Hexagon, as it fits the pattern of alternating shapes based on their geometric properties.

The correct answer is: E

1. Top row: Triangle with one triangle inside, Pentagon with two circles and one triangle inside, Circle with two circles and one triangle inside.
2. Middle row: Triangle with two circles and one triangle inside, Pentagon with one circle and two triangles inside, Circle with one circle and two triangles inside.
3. Bottom row: Triangle with two circles and one triangle inside, Pentagon with two circles and one triangle inside, Circle with two circles and one triangle inside.

The shapes in the grid include triangles, pentagons, and circles. Each shape contains a combination of circles and triangles. The pattern seems to involve the number and arrangement of circles and triangles within each shape.

Let's examine the options A to F:

- **A**: Circle with two circles and one triangle inside.
- **B**: Pentagon with two circles and one triangle inside.
- **C**: Circle with two circles and one triangle inside.
- **D**: Pentagon with two circles and one triangle inside.
- **E**: Circle with two circles and one triangle inside.
- **F**: Triangle with two circles and one triangle inside.

The pattern in the grid shows that the shapes alternate between triangles, pentagons, and circles. The shapes also have a consistent combination of two circles and one triangle inside.

Given this analysis, the correct answer should be a shape that fits the pattern of having two circles and one triangle inside, and it should alternate between a triangle, pentagons, and circles.

The correct answer is: **E**."

",False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern in the grid. The shapes in the grid are arranged in a specific sequence, and we need to identify the rule governing this sequence.

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - Top row: Square, Hexagon, Circle
   - Middle row: Hexagon, Triangle, Square
   - Bottom row: Circle, Square, Hexagon

2. **Observe the pattern:**
   - The shapes alternate between different types (Square, Hexagon, Circle, Triangle).
   - The sequence seems to follow a specific order: Square, Hexagon, Circle, Triangle.

3. **Determine the missing shape:**
   - The empty box is in the bottom row, third column.
   - Following the identified pattern (Square, Hexagon, Circle, Triangle), the sequence should be: Square, Hexagon, Circle, Triangle.
   - The third shape in this sequence is Circle.

4. **Verify the pattern:**
   - Top row: Square (1st), Hexagon (2nd), Circle (3rd)
   - Middle row: Hexagon (2nd), Triangle (3rd), Square (1st)
   - Bottom row: Circle (3rd), Square (1st), Hexagon (2nd)

The pattern holds true, and the missing shape is indeed a Circle.

1. Top row: Triangle with a small triangle inside, small triangle inside, and large triangle inside.
2. Middle row: Pentagon with a small hexagon inside, small hexagon inside, and large hexagon inside.
3. Bottom row: Triangle with a small circle inside, small circle inside, and an 'X'.

The pattern seems to involve the size and type of the shapes inside the larger shapes. Let's look at the options A to F:

- A: Pentagon with a small diamond inside.
- B: Pentagon with a small hexagon inside.
- C: Pentagon with a large hexagon inside.
- D: Triangle with a small hexagon inside.
- E: Pentagon with a small diamond inside.
- F: Triangle with a small diamond inside.

The pattern in the grid involves the larger shape and the type of smaller shape inside. The middle row has pentagons with hexagons inside, and the bottom row has triangles with circles inside. The top row has triangles with triangles inside.

To complete the pattern, we need a shape that fits the sequence of the bottom row, which has triangles with circles inside. The correct answer should be a triangle with a small diamond inside, matching the pattern of triangles with different smaller shapes inside.

The correct answer is: F"

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid**:
   - Top row: Dark triangle, dark square, dark circle
   - Middle row: Light square, light circle, light triangle
   - Bottom row: Dark hexagon, dark small square, light small square

2. **Determine the pattern**:
   - The shapes alternate between dark and light.
   - The shapes also alternate between different geometric forms: triangle, square, circle, and hexagon.

3. **Analyze the empty box**:
   - The empty box is in the bottom row, third column.
   - The shape to its left is a dark small square (B).
   - The shape above it is a light small square (C).

4. **Identify the pattern for the third column**:
   - The third column has a dark hexagon (A) at the top.
   - The middle shape is a light small square (C).
   - The bottom shape should be a dark small square (B).

Given these observations, the pattern alternates between dark and light shapes and also between different geometric forms. The correct shape for the empty box should be a dark small square (B), maintaining the pattern of alternating dark and light shapes and geometric forms.

3. **Determine the pattern:**
   - The top row shows a mix of different shapes.
   - The middle row shows a mix of different shapes.
   - The bottom row shows a consistent pattern of Pentagons (dark).

Given the consistency in the bottom row, it appears that the pattern involves having the same shape repeated in a row. Therefore, the correct answer should be a shape that can be repeated in a row without breaking the pattern.

4. **Match the options to the pattern:**
   - Options B, C, D, E, and F all contain multiple Pentagons (dark), which fits the pattern seen in the bottom row.

Since the bottom row has five Pentagons (dark), the option that fits best is:
