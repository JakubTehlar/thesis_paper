1. **Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes vary in type and color but do not seem to follow a clear pattern.
   - **Second Row:** Similar to the first row, the shapes are diverse and do not follow a straightforward transformation.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are again varied, with no clear pattern.

6. **Eliminate Options:**
   - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, and G do not fit the pattern of black hexagons.
   - Option H fits the pattern of a black hexagon.
