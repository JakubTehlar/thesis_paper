",False,"To solve this IQ test question, we need to carefully analyze the patterns in the 3x3 grid and deduce the correct shape for the empty box marked with 'x'.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes vary in type and color. There is no clear pattern in terms of shape transformation.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes are more consistent in type (hexagons) but vary in color and size.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are again varied in type and color.

2. **Observe the Changes Across Columns:**
   - **First Column:** The shapes vary in type and color.
   - **Second Column:** The shapes are primarily hexagons with variations in color and size.
   - **Third Column:** The shapes are varied in type and color.

3. **Observe the Diagonals:**
   - **First Diagonal:** The shapes are varied in type and color.
   - **Second Diagonal:** The shapes are primarily hexagons with variations in color and size.
   - **Third Diagonal:** The shapes are varied in type and color.

4. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The second row and second diagonal have a consistent pattern of hexagons.
   - The hexagons in the second row and second diagonal vary in color and size.

5. **Determine the Pattern:**
   - The consistent pattern seems to be the presence of hexagons in the second row and second diagonal.
   - The hexagons vary in color and size, suggesting that the color and size do not follow a strict pattern.

6. **Eliminate Options:**
   - Options that do not contain a hexagon can be eliminated.
   - Options that have hexagons but do not match the color and size variations can be eliminated.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the correct answer should be a hexagon that fits the pattern of the second row and second diagonal.
