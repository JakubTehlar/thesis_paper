1. **Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals:**
   - **Top Row:** The shapes are varied and do not seem to follow a clear pattern.
   - **Middle Row:** The shapes are also varied and do not follow a clear pattern.
   - **Bottom Row:** The shapes are varied and do not follow a clear pattern.

2. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - **Rotation:** There is no consistent rotation pattern.
   - **Mirroring:** There is no consistent mirroring pattern.
   - **Color Shades:** There are no color shades to consider.
   - **Element Counting:** There is no consistent change in the number of elements.

3. **Identify Unique Features in the Shapes:**
   - The shapes include squares, triangles, pentagons, and hexagons.
   - There is no consistent shape transformation.

4. **Eliminate Options (A to H) That Clearly Do Not Match the Observed Patterns:**
   - **Option A:** Contains squares.
   - **Option B:** Contains squares.
   - **Option C:** Contains circles.
   - **Option D:** Contains a mix of shapes.
   - **Option E:** Contains a mix of shapes.
   - **Option F:** Contains circles.
   - **Option G:** Contains circles.

5. **Select the Correct Shape That Completes the Pattern:**
   - Options C, F, and G contain circles.

Since circles are the most frequent shape, the most likely answer is one of the options with circles.
