1. **Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes are a square, a circle, and a triangle. The position of the inner shapes changes slightly.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes are a triangle, a circle, and a square. The position of the inner shapes changes slightly.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are a hexagon, a circle, and a hexagon. The position of the inner shapes changes slightly.

2. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - The shapes themselves do not change; they remain a square, circle, triangle, and hexagon.
   - The inner shapes (small circles) seem to shift positions within the larger shapes.

3. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The inner shapes (small circles) are consistently present within the larger shapes.
   - The larger shapes do not change their type (square, circle, triangle, hexagon).

4. **Eliminate Options:**
   - **A:** The inner shapes are not in the same position as the pattern.

3,Datasets/4_comp/output_data/na_os_nc_in_distribute_four_out_center_single_RAVEN_9967_val.png,G,F,False,"To solve this IQ test question, let's follow the steps methodically:

### Step 1: Carefully Observe the Changes
- **Top Row**: The shapes change from triangles to circles to diamonds.
- **Middle Row**: The shapes change from circles to diamonds to triangles.
- **Bottom Row**: The shapes change from diamonds to triangles to circles.

### Step 2: Look for Common Pattern Types
- **Shape Changes**: The shapes transition from one type to another in a specific order.
- **Rotation**: There doesn't seem to be a rotation involved.
- **Color Shades**: There are no color changes.
- **Element Counting**: The number of shapes remains consistent (three in each box).

### Step 3: Identify Unique Features
- The shapes change in a specific sequence: triangles -> circles -> diamonds.
- The sequence appears to repeat in a cyclic manner.

### Step 4: Eliminate Options
- **Option A**: Three circles (does not match the sequence).
- **Option B**: Two circles and one triangle (does not match the sequence).
- **Option C**: Three triangles (does not match the sequence).
- **Option D**: Two triangles and one circle (does not match the sequence).

- **Option F**: Two diamonds and one triangle (does not match the sequence).
- **Option G**: Two circles and one diamond (does not match the sequence).
- **Option H**: Three circles (does not match the sequence).

### Step 5: Select the Correct Shape
- The sequence follows: triangles -> circles -> diamonds -> triangles -> circles -> diamonds -> triangles.
- The correct answer should follow this sequence.

Given the sequence, the next shape after diamonds should be triangles. Therefore, the correct answer should be two diamonds and one triangle.

   - The secondary diagonal shows a consistent pattern of smaller shapes, but this does not seem to be the main pattern.

5. **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**
   - **A:** A circle does not fit the pattern of the main diagonal.
   - **B:** A triangle does not fit the pattern of the main diagonal.
   - **C:** A hexagon does not fit the pattern of the main diagonal.
