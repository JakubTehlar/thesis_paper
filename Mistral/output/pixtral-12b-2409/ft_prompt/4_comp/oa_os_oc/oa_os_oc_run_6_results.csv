The shapes in the grid include squares, diamonds, triangles, and hexagons, each in different shades of gray.

Let's break down the patterns:

1. **Rows and Columns Analysis**:
   - Each row and each column contains different shapes and shades.
   - The shapes are arranged in a way that each shape appears once in each row and column.

2. **Shapes and Shades**:
   - The shapes are squares, diamonds, triangles, and hexagons.
   - The shades are light gray, medium gray, and dark gray.

3. **Identifying the Missing Shape**:
   - The missing shape is in the bottom row, third column.
   - We need to find a shape that fits the pattern in the row and column.

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - In the third column, the shapes are: light gray square, dark gray triangle, and medium gray hexagon.
   - In the bottom row, the shapes are: light gray hexagon, dark gray circle, and medium gray triangle.

5. **Matching the Pattern**:
   - The third column has a dark gray triangle.

2. **Second Row**: All shapes are gray squares.
3. **Third Row**: The first two shapes are gray diamonds, and the third shape is an 'X'.

Now, let's look at the columns:

- **D**: Gray diamond
- **E**: White triangle
- **F**: White diamond

Given the pattern in the rows and columns, we can infer that the missing shape should follow the pattern of the third row, which alternates between gray diamonds and an 'X'. Since the third row already has an 'X', the missing shape should be a gray diamond.

   - Shape 3: Circle with a square inside

   The pattern in the first row is consistent: each shape is a circle with a square inside.

2. **Second Row:**
   - Shape 1: Square with a circle inside
   - Shape 2: Square with a circle inside
   - Shape 3: Square with a circle inside

   The pattern in the second row is also consistent: each shape is a square with a circle inside.

3. **Third Row:**

   - Shape 2: Hexagon with a circle inside
   - Shape 3: Cross mark

   The pattern in the third row is less clear, but it seems to involve hexagons with a circle inside.

Given the patterns observed, the consistent shapes are circles with a square inside and squares with a circle inside. The third row appears to be an outlier, possibly indicating a transition or a different pattern.

To fill the empty box, we need to determine the pattern that fits the context of the grid. Since the first and second rows have consistent shapes, we should look for a shape that fits within this context.

- **Option A:** Hexagon with a square inside

- **Option C:** Hexagon with a circle inside
- **Option D:** Hexagon with a circle inside
- **Option E:** Hexagon with a circle inside

2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a triangle, pentagon, and circle. The arrangement of the small squares within these shapes is different from the top row.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a triangle, pentagon, and circle. The arrangement of the small squares within these shapes is different from both the top and middle rows.

To find the pattern, we need to look at the arrangement of the small squares within each shape. Let's examine the small squares in each shape:

- **Triangle**: The small squares are arranged in a single column.
- **Pentagon**: The small squares are arranged in a row.
- **Circle**: The small squares are arranged in a row.

Now, let's look at the options A to F:
