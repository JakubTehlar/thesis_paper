Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

### Step 1: Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals

- **First Row:**
  - Hexagon to Circle to Square to Circle to Hexagon
  - Notice the change in shape and color.

- **Second Row:**
  - Diamond to Pentagon to Pentagon to Pentagon to Hexagon
  - Notice the change in shape and color.

- **Third Row:**
  - Pentagon to Circle to Hexagon to Circle to Cross
  - Notice the change in shape and color.

- **First Column:**
  - Hexagon to Diamond to Pentagon to Pentagon to Circle
  - Notice the change in shape and color.

- **Second Column:**
  - Circle to Pentagon to Pentagon to Circle to Diamond
  - Notice the change in shape and color.

- **Third Column:**
  - Square to Hexagon to Cross to Circle to Diamond
  - Notice the change in shape and color.

- **Diagonals:**
  - Top-left to bottom-right: Hexagon to Pentagon to Circle to Diamond to Cross
  - Top-right to bottom-left: Circle to Pentagon to Hexagon to Circle to Diamond

### Step 2: Look for Common Pattern Types

- **Shape Changes:** The shapes vary significantly (hexagon, circle, square, diamond, pentagon, cross).
- **Color Shifts:** The colors also vary (black, gray, white).
- **Element Counting:** The number of sides or elements in the shapes changes (e.g., hexagon has 6 sides, pentagon has 5 sides).

### Step 3: Identify Unique Features in the Shapes

- The shapes include regular polygons (hexagon, pentagon), a circle, a square, a diamond, and a cross.
- The colors range from black to gray to white.

### Step 4: Eliminate Options that Clearly Do Not Match

- **Option A:** Contains only circles and diamonds.
- **Option B:** Contains only circles and squares.
- **Option C:** Contains only circles and hexagons.
- **Option D:** Contains only diamonds and squares.
- **Option E:** Contains only diamonds and hexagons.
- **Option F:** Contains only circles and pentagons.
- **Option G:** Contains only diamonds and pentagons.
- **Option H:** Contains only circles and pentagons.

None of these options match the variety of shapes and colors in the grid.

### Step 5: Select the Correct Shape

Given the variety of shapes and colors, the correct answer should match the pattern observed in the grid. The empty box marked with 'x' should follow the pattern of shape and color changes.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows, Columns, and Diagonals:**
