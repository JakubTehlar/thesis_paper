1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes change from a hexagon to a circle to a square.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes change from a diamond to a pentagon to a hexagon.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes change from a pentagon to a circle to a hexagon.

4. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The shapes include hexagons, circles, squares, diamonds, and pentagons.
   - The colors range from black to dark gray to light gray.

### Pattern Identification:
- **Shape Transformation:** There is no consistent shape transformation across rows, columns, or diagonals.
- **Color Shading:** The color shading appears to change but does not follow a clear pattern.
- **Shape Counting:** The shapes seem to alternate between different types without a clear rule.

### Elimination Process:

- **Option E:** Contains only diamonds.
- **Option F:** Contains only diamonds.
- **Option G:** Contains a mix of shapes, including circles and diamonds.
- **Option H:** Contains a mix of shapes, including circles and diamonds.

Given the lack of a clear pattern in shape transformation, color shading, or shape counting, we need to consider the mix of shapes.

   - Options B, C, D, E, F, G, and H need to be checked against the pattern.

5. **Select the Correct Shape:**
   - For the empty box marked with 'x', we need to determine the next shape in the sequence.
   - Following the pattern, the sequence is circle → hexagon → triangle.
   - The shape in the box above the 'x' is a hexagon, so the next shape should be a triangle.
