   - **Second Column:** The shapes change from a circle to a pentagon to a circle.
   - **Third Column:** The shapes change from a square to a hexagon to a circle.

3. **Observe the Diagonals:**
   - **First Diagonal (Top-left to Bottom-right):** The shapes change from a hexagon to a pentagon to a circle.
