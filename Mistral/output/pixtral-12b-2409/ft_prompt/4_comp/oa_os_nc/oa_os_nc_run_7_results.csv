1. **Observe the shapes in the top row:**
   - The shapes start with a filled triangle, followed by an empty triangle, and then a filled inverted triangle.
   - There seems to be a pattern of alternating filled and empty shapes.

2. **Observe the shapes in the second row:**
   - The shapes start with a filled pentagon, followed by an empty pentagon, and then a filled hexagon.
   - Again, there is a pattern of alternating filled and empty shapes.

3. **Observe the shapes in the third row:**
   - The shapes start with a filled triangle, followed by an empty triangle, and then a filled inverted triangle.
   - This row also follows the alternating filled and empty shapes pattern.

4. **Observe the shapes in the fourth row:**
   - The shapes start with a filled pentagon, followed by an empty pentagon, and then a filled hexagon.
   - This row follows the same pattern of alternating filled and empty shapes.

5. **Identify the pattern:**
   - The pattern appears to be alternating between filled and empty shapes.
   - The shapes themselves are changing in a sequence: triangle, pentagon, hexagon.

6. **Apply the pattern to the empty box:**
   - The empty box is the third shape in the fourth row.
