### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows, Columns, and Diagonals:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes change from circles to hexagons to squares.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes change from hexagons to squares to pentagons.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes change from squares to pentagons to triangles.
   - **First Column:** The shapes change from circles to hexagons to squares.
   - **Second Column:** The shapes change from hexagons to squares to pentagons.
   - **Third Column:** The shapes change from squares to pentagons to triangles.
   - **Diagonal (Top Left to Bottom Right):** The shapes change from circles to hexagons to squares.
   - **Diagonal (Top Right to Bottom Left):** The shapes change from circles to hexagons to squares.

2. **Identify Common Pattern Types:**
   - The shapes seem to follow a sequence of transformations: circles → hexagons → squares → pentagons → triangles.
   - The sequence appears to be cyclic, meaning it repeats after a certain number of steps.

3. **Look for Unique Features in the Shapes:**
   - The shapes are different polygons: circles, hexagons, squares, pentagons, and triangles.
   - The sequence of shapes follows a specific order.

4. **Eliminate Options that Do Not Match the Observed Patterns:**
   - By examining the sequence, we can see that the correct shape for the empty box should be the next shape in the sequence after the square.
   - The sequence is: circles → hexagons → squares → pentagons → triangles.
   - Therefore, the shape after the square (which is a pentagon) should be a triangle.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is the shape that fits the observed pattern, which is a triangle.

The correct answer is: **G**."
