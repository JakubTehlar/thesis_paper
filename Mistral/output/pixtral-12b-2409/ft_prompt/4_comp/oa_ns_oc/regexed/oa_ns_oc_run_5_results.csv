1. **Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes change from circles to hexagons to squares.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes change from hexagons to squares to diamonds.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes change from squares to diamonds to pentagons.
   - **First Column:** The shapes change from circles to hexagons to squares.
   - **Second Column:** The shapes change from hexagons to squares to diamonds.
   - **Third Column:** The shapes change from squares to diamonds to pentagons.
   - **Main Diagonal (Top Left to Bottom Right):** The shapes change from circles to hexagons to squares.
   - **Secondary Diagonal (Top Right to Bottom Left):** The shapes change from circles to hexagons to squares.

2. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - The shapes seem to follow a sequence of transformations: circles → hexagons → squares → diamonds → pentagons.
   - The sequence appears to be cyclical, repeating every five shapes.

3. **Identify Unique Features in the Shapes:**
   - The shapes are different polygons: circles, hexagons, squares, diamonds, and pentagons.
   - The sequence of shapes follows a specific order.

4. **Eliminate Options That Clearly Do Not Match the Observed Patterns:**
   - By examining the options A to H, we can see that the correct answer should follow the sequence of shapes.
   - Options that do not follow the cyclical pattern of circles → hexagons → squares → diamonds → pentagons can be eliminated.

5. **Select the Correct Shape:**
   - The correct answer should be the fifth shape in the sequence, which is a pentagon.

1. **Observation of the Grid:**
   - The grid consists of nine boxes with various shapes inside them.
   - The bottom-right box is empty and marked with an 'x'.

**The correct answer is: H.**

This is based on the assumption that the pattern involves a mix of shapes without a specific rule, and option H is the only one that includes a variety of shapes similar to those in the matrix."
