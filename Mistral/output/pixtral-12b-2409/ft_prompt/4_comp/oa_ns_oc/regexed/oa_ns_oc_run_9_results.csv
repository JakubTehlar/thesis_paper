### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows, Columns, and Diagonals:**
   - **Rows:**
     - First row: The shapes vary in size and type but seem to be randomly placed.
     - Second row: The shapes are more varied in size and type.
     - Third row: The shapes are more consistent in size but vary in type.
   - **Columns:**
     - First column: The shapes vary in size and type.
     - Second column: The shapes vary in size and type.
     - Third column: The shapes vary in size and type.
   - **Diagonals:**
     - Main diagonal: The shapes vary in size and type.
     - Off-diagonals: The shapes vary in size and type.

2. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - **Rotation:** There doesn't seem to be a consistent rotation pattern.
   - **Mirroring:** There doesn't seem to be a consistent mirroring pattern.
   - **Color Shades:** The shapes are in black and white, but there is no consistent color pattern.
   - **Element Counting:** The number of shapes in each box varies.

3. **Identify Unique Features in the Shapes:**
   - The shapes include circles, squares, triangles, hexagons, and diamonds.
   - The sizes of the shapes vary from small to large.

4. **Eliminate Options That Clearly Do Not Match the Observed Patterns:**
   - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H need to be examined.
   - Since the shapes vary significantly in type and size, we need to look for a pattern that fits the overall variability.

5. **Select the Correct Shape:**
   - Given the variability in shapes and sizes, the correct answer should be a shape that fits the overall pattern without following a strict rule.
   - Option H seems to fit the variability and randomness observed in the grid.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is: **H**."
