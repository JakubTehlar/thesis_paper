### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows, Columns, and Diagonals:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes change from circles to hexagons to squares.

   - The sequence appears to be cyclical, repeating every five shapes.

3. **Unique Features in the Shapes:**
   - The shapes are distinct geometric figures: circles, hexagons, squares, pentagons, and triangles.
   - The sequence of transformations is consistent across rows, columns, and diagonals.

4. **Eliminate Options:**
   - By examining the sequence, we can eliminate options that do not fit the pattern.
   - Options A, C, D, E, and F do not match the cyclical pattern of transformations.
   - Options B, G, and H need to be checked for consistency.

5. **Select the Correct Shape:**
   - Option B: The sequence would be circles → hexagons → squares → pentagons → triangles → circles.
   - Option G: The sequence would be circles → hexagons → squares → pentagons → triangles → hexagons.
   - Option H: The sequence would be circles → hexagons → squares → pentagons → triangles → squares.

   The correct option should follow the observed pattern: circles → hexagons → squares → pentagons → triangles → circles.
