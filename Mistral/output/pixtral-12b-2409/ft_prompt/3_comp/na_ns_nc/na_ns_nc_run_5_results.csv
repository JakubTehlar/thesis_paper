0,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_nc_distribute_four_RAVEN_9992_train.png,E,A,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern formed by the shapes in the grid. The shapes in the grid are arranged in a specific sequence that follows a logical progression. Let's break down the pattern:

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - Top row: Circle, Hexagon, Pentagon
   - Middle row: Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle
   - Bottom row: Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle

2. **Observe the transformation between shapes:**
   - From a Circle to a Pentagon: The Circle becomes a Pentagon by adding two triangular sections to its sides.
   - From a Pentagon to a Hexagon: The Pentagon becomes a Hexagon by adding a triangular section to one of its sides.
   - From a Hexagon to a Circle: The Hexagon becomes a Circle by removing the triangular section.

3. **Determine the sequence:**
   - The sequence appears to be: Circle -> Pentagon -> Hexagon -> Circle.

4. **Apply the sequence to the empty box:**
   - The empty box is in the bottom row, third position.
   - The shape in the second position of the bottom row is a Hexagon.
   - Following the sequence, the Hexagon should transform into a Circle.

Therefore, the correct shape to fill the empty box is a Circle.

The correct answer is: A"
1,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_nc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9991_train.png,F,G,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects all the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a circle, a square, and a hexagon.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a circle, a square, and a hexagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a circle, a square, and a hexagon.

Next, we need to look at the pattern in the rows and columns:

- **First Column**: The shapes are a circle, a square, and a circle.
- **Second Column**: The shapes are a square, a circle, and a square.
- **Third Column**: The shapes are a hexagon, a square, and a hexagon.

From the analysis, we can see that the pattern alternates between a circle, a square, and a hexagon in each row and column. The empty box is in the third column and second row. Following the pattern:

- The shape in the first column of the second row is a circle.
- The shape in the second column of the second row is a square.
- Therefore, the shape in the third column of the second row should be a hexagon.

Thus, the correct answer is a hexagon.

2,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_nc_center_single_RAVEN_9991_train.png,E,F,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes step-by-step:

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - Top row: small triangle, small pentagon, large circle
   - Middle row: large triangle, large pentagon, small circle
   - Bottom row: small triangle, small circle, large pentagon

2. **Analyze the pattern:**
   - The shapes alternate between filled (gray) and unfilled (white).
   - The shapes alternate between different types (triangle, pentagon, circle).
   - The size of the shapes alternates between small and large.

3. **Determine the pattern for the empty box:**
   - The empty box is in the middle row, third column.
   - The shape to its left is a large pentagon (filled).
   - The shape above it is a small circle (unfilled).

4. **Apply the pattern rules to the empty box:**
   - Since the shape to its left is a large pentagon (filled), the shape in the empty box should be unfilled.
   - Since the shape above it is a small circle (unfilled), the shape in the empty box should be a large pentagon.

5. **Match the pattern with the options:**
   - Option A: Large filled circle
   - Option B: Small unfilled pentagon
   - Option C: Large filled circle
   - Option D: Large filled pentagon
   - Option E: Small unfilled circle
   - Option F: Large unfilled pentagon

Based on the analysis, the correct shape that fits the pattern is a large unfilled pentagon.

   - The shapes in the first row are all Circles.
   - The shapes in the second row are Diamonds and Triangles.
   - The shapes in the third row are all Hexagons.
   - The diagonal shapes show a mix of Circle, Triangle, and Hexagon.

Given these patterns, we need to determine which shape fits in the empty box to maintain the pattern. The empty box is in the third column and third row.

5. **Determine the correct shape for the empty box:**
   - The third column currently has Circle, Triangle, and Circle.
   - The third row currently has Hexagon, Hexagon, and Hexagon.

Considering the patterns, the third column should follow the pattern of the second column (Circle, Triangle, Hexagon), and the third row should follow the pattern of Hexagons.

Therefore, the shape that fits the pattern is a Hexagon.

5,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_ns_nc_in_center_single_out_center_single_RAVEN_9966_val.png,H,D**,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: Circle with square, pentagon with circle, triangle with hexagon.
2. Middle row: Circle with dot, pentagon with filled circle, triangle with filled circle.
3. Bottom row: Circle with diamond, pentagon with filled diamond, cross.

Next, we need to determine the pattern that applies to the empty box. The empty box is in the middle of the grid. Let's look at the shapes around it:

- Top-left: Circle with square.
- Top-right: Triangle with hexagon.
- Middle-left: Circle with dot.
- Middle-right: Triangle with filled circle.
- Bottom-left: Circle with diamond.
- Bottom-right: Cross.

Now, let's analyze the options (A to F) and see which one fits the pattern:

- A: Triangle with filled triangle.
- B: Triangle with empty triangle.
- C: Triangle with small triangle.
- D: Triangle with filled hexagon.
- E: Triangle with small triangle.
- F: Triangle with empty hexagon.

The pattern seems to involve shapes inside triangles. The shapes inside the triangles in the middle row and the bottom row are all circles or filled circles. The top row has a hexagon inside a triangle. The pattern could be that the shapes inside the triangles alternate between filled shapes and empty shapes.

Given this, the correct answer should be a triangle with a filled shape inside it. The option that fits this pattern is:

     - Hexagon to Triangle
     - Pentagon to Cross

3. **Determine the pattern:**
   - The shapes seem to be transforming from one geometric figure to another.
   - The transformation from the middle row to the bottom row involves changing Pentagon to Triangle and Hexagon to Triangle.

   - Shape 3: Square with a small diamond inside.

2. **Middle Row**:

3. **Bottom Row**: 
   - Shape 7: Pentagon with a small square inside.
   - Shape 8: Pentagon with a small square inside.
   - Shape 9: Pentagon with a small square inside.

From this analysis, we can see that the shapes alternate between pentagons, triangles, and squares. The shapes also alternate between having a small square or diamond inside.

Given this pattern, the empty box (marked with a question mark) should follow the pattern of the previous shapes. The previous shape in the top row is a square with a small diamond inside. Following the pattern, the next shape should be a pentagon with a small square inside.

Therefore, the correct answer is a pentagon with a small square inside.

2. Middle row: Pentagon with two dots, Pentagon with three dots, Pentagon with two dots.
3. Bottom row: Hexagon with three dots, Hexagon with two dots, Hexagon with two dots.

Now, let's look at the options A to F:

- A: Hexagon with three triangles.
- B: Hexagon with two triangles and one dot.
- C: Hexagon with three circles.
- D: Hexagon with two triangles and one circle.
- E: Hexagon with two triangles and one triangle.
- F: Hexagon with three circles.

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern that relates the shapes in the grid to the options. One possible pattern could be the number of dots or shapes inside the polygons.

Let's analyze the number of dots or shapes inside the polygons:

- Top row: 3, 2, 2 (dots or squares).
- Middle row: 2, 3, 2 (dots).
- Bottom row: 3, 2, 2 (dots).

The pattern seems to involve the number of dots or shapes inside the polygons. The empty box in the grid has 2 dots.

Now, let's match this pattern with the options:

- B: 2 triangles and 1 dot (does not match).
- C: 3 circles (does not match).
- D: 2 triangles and 1 circle (does not match).
- E: 2 triangles and 1 triangle (does not match).
- F: 3 circles (does not match).

None of the options exactly match the pattern of 2 dots in the hexagon. However, the closest match is option F, which has 3 circles, but this does not fit the pattern of 2 dots.
