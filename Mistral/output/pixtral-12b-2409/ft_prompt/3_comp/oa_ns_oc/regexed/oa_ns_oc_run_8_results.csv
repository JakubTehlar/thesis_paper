2. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The shapes include pentagons, hexagons, squares, triangles, and a cross.
   - The colors range from black to gray to white.
   - Some shapes are filled, while others are outlined.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Observation of the Grid:**
   - The grid consists of shapes within hexagons and diamonds.
   - Each shape within the hexagon or diamond appears to be a combination of smaller geometric shapes like circles, squares, and triangles.

2. **Identifying Patterns:**
   - **First Row:** 
     - The shapes change from left to right. The first shape is a hexagon with a circle and a square, the second is a hexagon with two circles and a square, and the third is a hexagon with three circles.
   - **Second Row:**
     - The shapes change from left to right. The first shape is a diamond with a circle and a square, the second is a diamond with two circles and a square, and the third is a diamond with three circles.
   - **Third Row:**
     - The shapes change from left to right. The first shape is a diamond with a circle and a square, the second is a diamond with two circles and a square, and the third is a diamond with three circles.

   - The shapes in the first column are hexagons with one circle and one square.
   - The shapes in the second column are hexagons with two circles and one square.
   - The shapes in the third column are hexagons with three circles.
   - The shapes in the first column are diamonds with one circle and one square.
   - The shapes in the second column are diamonds with two circles and one square.
   - The shapes in the third column are diamonds with three circles.

4. **Identifying the Rule:**
   - The rule appears to be that the number of circles increases from left to right in each row, and the shape alternates between hexagons and diamonds.

5. **Applying the Rule:**
   - For the bottom-right box, which is empty, we need to follow the pattern:
     - The third column has hexagons.
     - The number of circles increases from left to right.
     - Therefore, the shape should be a hexagon with three circles.

6. **Matching the Correct Option:**
   - Looking at the options A to H, the correct shape that matches the pattern is option H, which is a hexagon with three circles.

   - The first row has a consistent hexagon shape with different internal configurations.
   - The second row has a consistent hexagon shape with different internal configurations.
   - The third row has a mix of different external shapes (circle, hexagon, cross).

4. **Eliminate Options (A to H) That Clearly Do Not Match the Observed Patterns:**
   - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H all show hexagons with internal dots.
   - Since the third row does not follow the hexagon pattern, we need to focus on the external shape of the third row.

5. **Select the Correct Shape That Completes the Pattern:**
   - The third row shows a circle, a hexagon, and a cross.
   - The correct answer should match the external shape pattern of the third row.
