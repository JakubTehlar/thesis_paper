1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes change from a circle to a pentagon, then to a hexagon, and finally to a black circle.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes change from a black circle to a triangle, then to a circle, a square, and a pentagon.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes change from a circle to a pentagon, a black circle, a hexagon, and an 'x'.

   - **Second Diagonal:** The shapes change from a black circle to a square to an 'x'.

4. **Identify Patterns:**
   - **Shape Changes:** There is no consistent shape change pattern across rows or columns.
   - **Color Changes:** There is a mix of black and gray circles, but no clear pattern.
   - **Unique Features:** The 'x' in the bottom-right box might indicate a missing shape or a placeholder.

5. **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**
   - **Option A:** Contains a black circle, triangle, and circle.
