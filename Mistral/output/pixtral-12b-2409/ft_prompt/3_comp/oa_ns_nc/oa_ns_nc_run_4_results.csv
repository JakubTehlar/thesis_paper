### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes change from a filled circle to a half-filled circle to an empty circle.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes change from a filled hexagon to a half-filled hexagon to a small square.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes change from a filled pentagon to a half-filled pentagon to an empty pentagon.

2. **Observe the Changes Across Columns:**
   - **First Column:** The shapes change from a filled circle to a filled hexagon to a filled pentagon.
   - **Second Column:** The shapes change from a half-filled circle to a half-filled hexagon to a half-filled pentagon.
   - **Third Column:** The shapes change from an empty circle to an empty hexagon to an empty pentagon.

3. **Observe the Changes Across Diagonals:**
   - **Top-left to Bottom-right:** The shapes change from a filled circle to a half-filled hexagon to an empty pentagon.
   - **Top-right to Bottom-left:** The shapes change from an empty circle to a half-filled hexagon to a filled pentagon.

4. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - The pattern appears to involve a transformation from filled shapes to half-filled shapes to empty shapes.
   - The shapes themselves (circle, hexagon, pentagon) do not seem to follow a specific transformation rule.

5. **Determine the Shape for the Empty Box:**
   - Based on the pattern observed, the empty box should follow the transformation rule of the third row.
   - The third row shows a transition from a filled pentagon to a half-filled pentagon to an empty pentagon.
   - Therefore, the shape in the empty box should be an empty pentagon.
