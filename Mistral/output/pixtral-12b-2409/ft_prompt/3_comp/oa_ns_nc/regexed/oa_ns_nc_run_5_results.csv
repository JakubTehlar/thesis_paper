### Step 1: Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals

- **First Row:**
  - Shape 1: Large circle (gray)
  - Shape 2: Large circle (gray)
  - Shape 3: Large circle (white)

- **Second Row:**
  - Shape 1: Hexagon (gray)
  - Shape 2: Hexagon (gray)
  - Shape 3: Small square (black)

- **Third Row:**
  - Shape 1: Large hexagon (gray)
  - Shape 2: Large hexagon (gray)
  - Shape 3: Small square (black)

- **Fourth Row:**
  - Shape 1: Hexagon (gray)
  - Shape 2: Hexagon (gray)
  - Shape 3: Cross (X)

- **Fifth Row:**
  - Shape 1: Large circle (gray)
  - Shape 2: Hexagon (gray)
  - Shape 3: Cross (X)

### Step 2: Look for Common Pattern Types

- **Shape Changes:**
  - The shapes vary significantly across rows and columns, with no clear transformation pattern (e.g., rotation, scaling).

- **Color Shades:**
  - The colors vary, but there is no consistent pattern of color change.

- **Element Counting:**
  - The number of sides or vertices of the shapes does not follow a consistent pattern.

### Step 3: Identify Unique Features in the Shapes

- The shapes are diverse and include circles, hexagons, squares, and crosses.
- The colors range from gray to white and black.
- The sizes vary from large to small.

### Step 4: Eliminate Options (A to H) That Clearly Do Not Match the Observed Patterns

- **Option A:** Hexagon (gray)
- **Option B:** Large circle (gray)
- **Option C:** Small square (black)
- **Option D:** Large hexagon (gray)
- **Option E:** Hexagon (gray)
- **Option F:** Large circle (gray)
- **Option G:** Small square (black)
- **Option H:** Hexagon (gray)

Given the diversity of shapes and colors, it is challenging to identify a clear pattern. However, the last row has a cross (X), which is unique. We should look for a shape that fits the context of the grid.

### Step 5: Select the Correct Shape That Completes the Pattern

Given the lack of a clear pattern, the best approach is to choose a shape that logically fits the context of the grid. The cross (X) is unique and appears in the fourth row, third column. Therefore, the most logical choice is to select a shape that is consistent with this placement.

### Conclusion
