0,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_ns_nc_up_center_single_down_center_single_RAVEN_9822_train.png,H,H,False,"To solve this IQ test question, we need to carefully analyze the patterns in the 3x3 grid and deduce the correct shape that should be placed in the empty box.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes change from a filled circle to a half-filled circle to an empty circle.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes change from a filled hexagon to a half-filled hexagon to a small square.
