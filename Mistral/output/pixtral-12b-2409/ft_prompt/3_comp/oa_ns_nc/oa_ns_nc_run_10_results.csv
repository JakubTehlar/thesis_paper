Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - First Row: The shapes change from a filled circle to a half-filled circle to an empty circle.
   - Second Row: The shapes change from a filled hexagon to a half-filled hexagon to a small square.
   - Third Row: The shapes change from a filled hexagon to a half-filled hexagon to a small square.

2. **Observe the Changes Across Columns:**
   - First Column: The shapes change from a filled circle to a filled hexagon to a filled circle.
   - Second Column: The shapes change from a half-filled circle to a half-filled hexagon to a half-filled hexagon.
   - Third Column: The shapes change from an empty circle to a small square to an empty circle.

3. **Observe the Changes Across Diagonals:**
   - Main Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): The shapes change from a filled circle to a half-filled hexagon to an empty circle.
   - Secondary Diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): The shapes change from an empty circle to a small square to a filled circle.

4. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - The pattern seems to involve a transformation from a filled shape to a half-filled shape to an empty shape.
   - The shapes themselves (circle, hexagon, square) do not seem to follow a strict transformation rule across rows, columns, or diagonals.

5. **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**
   - Options A, C, D, E, F, and G do not match the pattern of transitioning from filled to half-filled to empty shapes.
   - Options B and H need to be checked for the correct transformation.

6. **Check Options B and H:**
   - Option B: The sequence is a filled hexagon, half-filled hexagon, empty hexagon.
   - Option H: The sequence is a filled hexagon, half-filled hexagon, empty hexagon.

Both options B and H follow the pattern of transitioning from filled to half-filled to empty shapes. However, we need to ensure that the shapes in the sequence match the pattern observed in the grid.

7. **Final Verification:**
   - The correct answer should match the transformation observed in the main diagonal (filled circle to half-filled hexagon to empty circle).
   - Option B matches this pattern more closely.
