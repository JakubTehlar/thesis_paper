1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - First Row: The shapes are a pentagon with a circle, a pentagon with a small pentagon, and a pentagon with a triangle.
   - Second Row: The shapes are a circle with a circle, a circle with a small pentagon, and a circle with a triangle.

- **Color Changes:**
  - The colors alternate between dark and light shades.

### Step 3: Identify Unique Features in the Shapes

- The shapes vary in form and color.
- The shapes in the last column are consistently circles.
