1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - First Row: The shapes are a pentagon, a pentagon with a pentagon inside, and a pentagon with a triangle inside.
   - Second Row: The shapes are a circle, a circle with a pentagon inside, and a circle with a triangle inside.
   - Third Row: The shapes are a triangle with a circle inside, a triangle with a pentagon inside, and an 'x'.

2. **Observe the Changes Across Columns:**
   - First Column: The shapes are a pentagon with a circle inside, a circle with a circle inside, and a triangle with a circle inside.
   - Second Column: The shapes are a pentagon with a pentagon inside, a circle with a pentagon inside, and a triangle with a pentagon inside.
   - Third Column: The shapes are a pentagon with a triangle inside, a circle with a triangle inside, and a triangle with a triangle inside.

3. **Observe the Changes Across Diagonals:**
   - Top-left to bottom-right: The shapes are a pentagon with a circle inside, a circle with a pentagon inside, and a triangle with a triangle inside.
   - Top-right to bottom-left: The shapes are a pentagon with a triangle inside, a circle with a triangle inside, and a triangle with a circle inside.

4. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - The shapes in the first row show a progression from a pentagon to a pentagon with a pentagon inside, to a pentagon with a triangle inside.
   - The shapes in the second row show a progression from a circle to a circle with a pentagon inside, to a circle with a triangle inside.
   - The shapes in the third row show a progression from a triangle with a circle inside to a triangle with a pentagon inside, to a triangle with a triangle inside.

5. **Determine the Rule:**
   - The rule seems to be that each shape in the row transitions from containing a circle to a pentagon to a triangle.

6. **Apply the Rule to the Bottom-Right Box:**
   - The shape in the third row, third column, should follow the same rule. The shape above it (triangle with a pentagon inside) suggests the next shape should be a triangle with a triangle inside.

7. **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**
   - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, and G do not match the identified pattern of a triangle with a triangle inside.

8. **Select the Correct Answer:**
