1. Top row: Hexagon with triangle, Square with triangle, Circle with triangle.
2. Middle row: Circle with square, Hexagon with square, Square with square.
3. Bottom row: Diamond with circle, Circle with circle, Hexagon with circle, Cross.

First, let's observe the shapes:
- The shapes in the grid are varied: hexagons, squares, circles, diamonds, and crosses.
- Each shape contains another shape inside it: a triangle, square, or circle.

Next, let's look at the arrangement:
- The shapes are arranged in a 3x3 grid.
- The shapes in the first column are a hexagon, circle, and diamond.
- The shapes in the second column are a square, hexagon, and circle.
- The shapes in the third column are a square, hexagon, and circle.

Now, let's examine the options provided (A to F):

- A: Large circle
- B: Square
- C: Small circle
- D: Small square
- E: Small square
- F: Small circle

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the relationships between the shapes in the grid. One possible pattern could be based on the size and type of the shapes.

Observing the grid:
- The top row has a mix of different shapes (pentagon, hexagon, triangle).
- The middle row has a mix of different shapes (triangle, circle, inverted triangle).
- The bottom row has a mix of different shapes (circle, square, circle).

Given this, the pattern might be that each row has a different shape, and the shapes alternate in size and type.

Let's fill the empty box with the correct shape:
- The empty box is in the middle row, third column.
- The shapes in the middle row are triangle, circle, and inverted triangle.
- The shape in the third column of the middle row should be a circle.

Thus, the correct answer is a small circle, which corresponds to option C.

2. **Second Row**: The shapes are a large hexagon, a medium hexagon, and a small hexagon.
3. **Third Row**: The shapes are a large circle, a medium circle, and an 'X'.

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the transformation from one shape to the next. The shapes seem to be decreasing in size from left to right in each row.

Now, let's examine the options A to F:

- **A**: A large circle
- **B**: A black triangle
- **C**: A medium circle
- **D**: A black circle
- **E**: A large black circle
- **F**: A white triangle

3. The third shape is a circle with a filled circle inside it.

Now, let's look at the options provided:

- A: Circle with a square inside

- C: Circle with a square inside
- D: Circle with a square inside
- E: Circle with a square inside
- F: Circle with a square inside

All the options (A to F) have a circle with a square inside it. Given that the sequence shows a transition from a triangle to a pentagon to a circle, and the shapes inside them change from a square to a triangle to a filled circle, we need to identify the pattern in the shapes inside the circles.

The sequence inside the shapes is:
- Triangle with a square
- Pentagon with a triangle
- Circle with a filled circle

The next shape in the sequence should follow this pattern. Since the last shape is a circle with a filled circle inside, the next shape should be a circle with a square inside it, following the pattern of shapes inside the circles.

Therefore, the correct answer is any of the options (A to F), as they all fit the pattern of having a circle with a square inside it.
