   - **Second Diagonal:** The shapes are a pentagon, circle, and hexagon.

4. **Identify Patterns:**
   - **Shape Transformation:** There is no clear transformation in shape type across rows, columns, or diagonals.
   - **Color Shading:** The shading of the shapes changes, but it does not follow a consistent pattern.
   - **Counting Elements:** The number of sides of the shapes does not change consistently.

5. **Unique Features:**
   - The shapes are varied (circles, pentagons, triangles, squares, hexagons).
   - The shading of the shapes varies.

6. **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**
   - **Option A:** A circle with light shading.
   - **Option B:** A circle with medium shading.
