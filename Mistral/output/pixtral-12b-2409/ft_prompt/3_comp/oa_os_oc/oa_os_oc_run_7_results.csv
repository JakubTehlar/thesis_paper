1. **Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes are a pentagon, irregular pentagon, and a circle. There is no clear transformation pattern in terms of shape or color.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes are a circle, hexagon, and a pentagon. Again, no clear transformation pattern.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are a pentagon, circle, and an 'X'. No clear transformation pattern.

2. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - **Shape Changes:** There doesn't seem to be a consistent shape change.
   - **Color Shades:** The colors range from light gray to dark gray and black, but there is no consistent pattern in the color shades.
   - **Element Counting:** The number of sides or elements in the shapes varies, but there is no consistent pattern.

3. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The shapes vary in complexity and number of sides.
   - The colors range from light gray to dark gray and black.

4. **Eliminate Options:**
   - **A:** A triangle, which is not present in the grid.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Observation of the Grid:**
   - The grid contains various shapes: circles, triangles, and hexagons.
   - Each shape has a different symbol inside: a triangle, a circle, or a filled circle.

2. **Identifying Patterns:**
   - Let's look at the rows:
     - First row: Circle with triangle, Hexagon with filled circle, Triangle with filled circle.
     - Second row: Triangle with triangle, Circle with circle, Hexagon with filled circle.
     - Third row: Hexagon with triangle, Triangle with circle, Circle with filled circle.
   - Let's look at the columns:
     - First column: Circle with triangle, Triangle with triangle, Hexagon with triangle.
     - Second column: Hexagon with filled circle, Circle with circle, Triangle with filled circle.
     - Third column: Triangle with filled circle, Hexagon with filled circle, Circle with filled circle.

     - Top-left to bottom-right: Circle with triangle, Hexagon with filled circle, Triangle with filled circle.
     - Top-right to bottom-left: Triangle with triangle, Circle with circle, Circle with filled circle.

3. **Analyzing Transformations:**
   - The shapes seem to be changing in a systematic way. The key might be the symbols inside the shapes.
   - Notice that the filled circle appears to be moving from one shape to another.

4. **Identifying the Rule:**
   - The filled circle appears to be moving from one shape to another in a consistent manner. Let's follow the filled circle:
     - From the first row, second column to the second row, second column, and then to the third row, second column.
     - This suggests that the filled circle moves diagonally from the second column to the second column.

5. **Applying the Rule:**
   - Following the rule, the filled circle should move from the second column to the second column in the bottom row.
   - The shape in the bottom row, second column should be a hexagon with a filled circle.

6. **Eliminating Incorrect Options:**
   - Options A, B, C, and H are circles, which do not match the identified pattern.
   - Options D, E, F, and G are hexagons, but only one of them has a filled circle.
