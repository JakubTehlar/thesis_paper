1. **Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes are a pentagon, irregular pentagon, and a circle. There is no clear transformation pattern in this row.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes are a circle, hexagon, and a pentagon. Again, no clear transformation pattern.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are a pentagon, circle, and an 'X'. No clear transformation pattern here either.

2. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - **Shape Types:** The shapes include pentagons, circles, and irregular shapes. There is no consistent shape type.
   - **Color Shades:** The shapes vary in shades of gray. This could be a potential pattern.
   - **Size:** The sizes of the shapes vary, which might be another potential pattern.

3. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The shapes vary in complexity and color shades.
   - The last row has an 'X' which is different from the other shapes.

4. **Eliminate Options:**
   - Options A, E, and F are triangles, which do not match the shapes in the grid.
   - Options G and H are small triangles, which do not match the complexity of the shapes in the grid.
   - Options B and C are small hexagons, which do not match the complexity of the shapes in the grid.
   - Option D is a hexagon, which is similar to one of the shapes in the grid.

5. **Select the Correct Shape:**
   - Given the variations in color shades and sizes, the most likely pattern is a variation in color shades.
   - Option D is a hexagon, which matches one of the shapes in the grid and fits the pattern of varying shades of gray.
