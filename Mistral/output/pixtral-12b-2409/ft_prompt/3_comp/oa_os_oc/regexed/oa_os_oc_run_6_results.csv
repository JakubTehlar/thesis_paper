1. **Observation of Rows:**
   - First Row: The shapes are a pentagon, irregular pentagon, and a circle. There is no clear pattern in terms of shape transformation.
   - Second Row: The shapes are a circle, hexagon, and a pentagon. Again, no clear pattern in shape transformation.
   - Third Row: The shapes are a pentagon, circle, and an 'X'. No clear pattern in shape transformation.

2. **Observation of Columns:**
   - First Column: The shapes are a pentagon, circle, and pentagon. There is no clear pattern in terms of shape transformation.
   - Second Column: The shapes are an irregular pentagon, hexagon, and circle. No clear pattern in shape transformation.

   - Secondary Diagonal: The shapes are a circle, irregular pentagon, and pentagon. No clear pattern in shape transformation.

4. **Color Analysis:**
   - The shapes vary in shades of gray and black. There is no consistent color transformation across rows, columns, or diagonals.

5. **Shape Analysis:**
   - The shapes vary in type (pentagon, circle, hexagon, irregular pentagon, and 'X'). There is no consistent shape transformation.

6. **Unique Features:**
   - The 'X' in the third row, third column, is unique and does not fit the pattern of other shapes.

Given the lack of a clear pattern in shape transformation, color, or any other obvious rule, we need to consider the unique feature of the 'X'. The 'X' might indicate a break in the pattern or a special condition.

7. **Eliminating Options:**
   - Options A, B, C, E, F, G, and H do not match the unique 'X' shape.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The unique 'X' shape suggests that the correct answer might be a special condition or a break in the pattern.
