1. **Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes are a triangle, square, and pentagon. Each shape contains different symbols.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes are a triangle, square, and pentagon. Each shape contains different symbols.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are a pentagon, hexagon, and an empty box.

2. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - The shapes are different polygons (triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon).
   - The symbols within the shapes vary in type and number.

3. **Identify Unique Features in the Shapes:**
   - The symbols within the shapes are varied and do not follow a simple numerical or rotational pattern.
   - The shapes themselves change from one polygon type to another.

4. **Eliminate Options (A to H) That Clearly Do Not Match the Observed Patterns:**
