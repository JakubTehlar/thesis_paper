- **Row 3**: The shapes are circles, diamonds, and triangles.

### Step 3: Look for Common Patterns
- **Shape Transformation**: The shapes within the polygons do not change significantly but are arranged differently.
- **Polygon Transformation**: The polygons themselves change from one shape to another (triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon).

### Step 4: Eliminate Options
Let's look at the options provided (A to H) and see which one fits the pattern.

- **Option A**: Contains a mix of shapes but not following the pattern observed.
