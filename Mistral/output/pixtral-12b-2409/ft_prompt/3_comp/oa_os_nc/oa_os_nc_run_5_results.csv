To determine the pattern, we need to identify the relationship between the shapes in the grid. One possible pattern could be the alternation of shapes based on their number of sides or their geometric properties.

Let's analyze the pattern by focusing on the number of sides:

- **First row**: Hexagon, Circle, Pentagon
- **Second row**: Triangle, Square, Pentagon
- **Third row**: Hexagon, Circle, Pentagon

We can see that the shapes alternate between polygons (hexagon, triangle, square) and non-polygons (circle, pentagon).

Given this pattern, the empty box in the grid should follow the same alternation. Since the previous shape was a pentagon (a non-polygon), the next shape should be a polygon.

Looking at the options, the polygon shapes are:
