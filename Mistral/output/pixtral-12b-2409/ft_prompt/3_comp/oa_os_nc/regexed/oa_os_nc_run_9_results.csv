1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes change from a triangle to a circle to a pentagon.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes change from a pentagon to a circle to a triangle.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes change from a circle to a pentagon to a triangle.

   - **Second Diagonal (Top Right to Bottom Left):** The shapes change from a circle to a triangle to a pentagon.

4. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - The shapes in the grid seem to follow a rotational pattern. Specifically, the shapes rotate in a clockwise direction.
   - Let's verify this by rotating each shape in the grid by 90 degrees clockwise:
     - **First Row:** Triangle -> Pentagon -> Circle
     - **Second Row:** Pentagon -> Circle -> Triangle
     - **Third Row:** Circle -> Pentagon -> Triangle

5. **Apply the Pattern to the Empty Box:**
   - The shape directly above the empty box in the third row is a circle.
