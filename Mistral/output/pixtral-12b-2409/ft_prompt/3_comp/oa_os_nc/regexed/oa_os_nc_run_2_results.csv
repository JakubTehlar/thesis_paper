   - **Second Diagonal (Top Right to Bottom Left):** The shapes change from a circle to a triangle to a pentagon.

4. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - The pattern seems to involve a rotation of shapes. Specifically, the shapes rotate in a clockwise direction.
   - Let's check the rotation:
     - Triangle → Pentagon → Circle
     - Pentagon → Circle → Triangle
     - Circle → Triangle → Pentagon
