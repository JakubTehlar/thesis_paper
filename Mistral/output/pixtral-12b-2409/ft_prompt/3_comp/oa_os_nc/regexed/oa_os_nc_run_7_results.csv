0,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_os_nc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9928_test.png,H,E,False,"To solve this IQ test question, we need to carefully analyze the patterns in the 3x3 grid and deduce the rule that governs the transformations of the shapes. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes change from a triangle to a circle, pentagon, and then back to a triangle.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes change from a pentagon to a circle, larger circle, and then a triangle.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes change from a circle to a smaller circle, pentagon, and then a triangle.

2. **Observe the Changes Across Columns:**
   - **First Column:** The shapes change from a triangle to a pentagon, and then a circle.
   - **Second Column:** The shapes change from a circle to a larger circle, and then a pentagon.
   - **Third Column:** The shapes change from a pentagon to a triangle, and then a smaller circle.

3. **Observe the Diagonals:**
   - **First Diagonal:** The shapes change from a triangle to a circle, and then a pentagon.
   - **Second Diagonal:** The shapes change from a pentagon to a larger circle, and then a triangle.
   - **Third Diagonal:** The shapes change from a circle to a smaller circle, and then a triangle.

4. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The shapes include triangles, circles, and pentagons.
   - The shapes vary in size (small, medium, large).
   - The shapes are shaded in different shades of gray.

5. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - **Rotation:** The shapes do not seem to rotate.
   - **Mirroring:** The shapes do not seem to mirror.
   - **Color Shades:** The shades of gray do not seem to follow a consistent pattern.
   - **Element Counting:** The number of sides of the shapes changes (3 for triangles, 0 for circles, 5 for pentagons).

6. **Eliminate Options:**
   - By examining the options A to H, we can see that some options do not follow the observed patterns. For example, options that have shapes with different numbers of sides or inconsistent sizes can be eliminated.

7. **Select the Correct Shape:**
   - After careful examination, the correct answer should follow the pattern observed in the grid. The shapes should transition from a triangle to a circle, and then to a pentagon.

1,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_os_nc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9974_train.png,G,D,False,"To solve this IQ test question, we need to carefully analyze the patterns in the shapes provided in the matrix. Here are the steps to deduce the correct answer:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows and Columns:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes change from circles to pentagons to triangles.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes change from pentagons to circles to pentagons.

2. **Observe the Changes Across Diagonals:**
   - **First Diagonal:** The shapes change from circles to pentagons to triangles.
   - **Second Diagonal:** The shapes change from pentagons to circles to pentagons.

3. **Identify the Transformation Rule:**
   - The shapes seem to follow a pattern where each shape is replaced by another in a specific sequence. The sequence appears to be:
     - Circle → Pentagon → Triangle
     - Pentagon → Circle → Pentagon
     - Pentagon → Triangle → Pentagon

4. **Apply the Transformation Rule to the Empty Box:**
   - The empty box is in the bottom-right corner of the matrix.
   - The shape directly above it is a triangle.
   - According to the pattern, the triangle should be replaced by a pentagon.

5. **Eliminate Incorrect Options:**
   - Options A, B, C, E, F, G, and H do not match the identified pattern of replacing a triangle with a pentagon.

6. **Select the Correct Answer:**

2,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_os_nc_in_distribute_four_out_center_single_RAVEN_9998_test.png,C,N,False,"To solve this IQ test question, we need to carefully analyze the patterns in the 3x3 grid of shapes and deduce the rule that governs the transformations from one shape to the next. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes are pentagons with different internal patterns. The first pentagon has a circle and an inverted triangle, the second has a triangle and a circle, and the third has a square.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes are circles with different internal patterns. The first circle has a square and two circles, the second has a triangle and a circle, and the third has a single circle.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are pentagons with different internal patterns. The first pentagon has a square and two circles, the second has two circles, and the third is crossed out.

2. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - **Shape Changes:** The shapes change from pentagons to circles and back to pentagons.
   - **Internal Patterns:** The internal patterns within the shapes change in complexity and number of elements.

3. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The crossed-out shape in the third row suggests an anomaly or a break in the pattern.
   - The internal patterns within the shapes vary significantly, making it difficult to identify a straightforward transformation rule.

4. **Eliminate Options:**
   - **Options A, B, C, D:** These options show pentagons with different internal patterns. Given the complexity and variability of the internal patterns, these options do not follow a clear rule.
   - **Options E, F, G, H:** These options show triangles with internal patterns. Since the original grid does not contain any triangles, these options can be eliminated.

5. **Select the Correct Shape:**
   - Given the elimination process, none of the options A to H match the observed patterns in the grid. The crossed-out shape in the third row suggests that the pattern might be incomplete or intentionally broken.

**Conclusion:**
The correct answer is not provided among the options A to H.

   - **Second Row:** The shapes are a hexagon, triangle, and circle. The symbols inside the shapes are different from the first row.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are a triangle, circle, and hexagon. The symbols inside the shapes are different from the previous rows.

2. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - **Shape Types:** The shapes are consistently a circle, hexagon, and triangle in each row.
   - **Symbols Inside Shapes:** The symbols inside the shapes change in each row. There doesn't seem to be a consistent transformation of the symbols themselves.

3. **Identify Unique Features in the Shapes:**
   - Each shape (circle, hexagon, triangle) contains different symbols.
   - The arrangement of symbols within each shape varies.

4. **Eliminate Options (A to H) That Clearly Do Not Match the Observed Patterns:**
   - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H show hexagons with different arrangements of symbols inside.
   - Since the grid shows different shapes (circle, hexagon, triangle) and not just hexagons, we can eliminate options that do not match the shape type.

5. **Select the Correct Shape That Completes the Pattern:**
   - The bottom-right box is empty and marked with a symbol 'x'.
   - The pattern in the grid does not follow a consistent transformation of symbols within the shapes but rather changes the shape type.
   - The correct answer should match the shape type of the adjacent shapes in the grid.

Given the observed pattern, the correct answer should be a shape that matches the type of the adjacent shapes in the grid. The adjacent shapes are a circle and a triangle, so the correct answer should be a shape that fits this pattern.
