Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - First Row: The shapes change from a triangle to a circle, pentagon, hexagon, large circle, and back to a triangle.
   - Second Row: The shapes change from a pentagon to a circle, large circle, triangle, and back to a pentagon.
   - Third Row: The shapes change from a circle to a triangle, small circle, pentagon, and an 'X'.

   - Third Column: The shapes change from a pentagon to a triangle to a pentagon.
   - Fourth Column: The shapes change from a hexagon to a triangle to a small circle.
   - Fifth Column: The shapes change from a large circle to an 'X'.

3. **Observe the Diagonals:**
   - Main Diagonal: The shapes change from a triangle to a large circle to a small circle.
   - Secondary Diagonal: The shapes change from a circle to a triangle to a small circle.

4. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The shapes include triangles, circles, pentagons, hexagons, and an 'X'.
   - The shapes vary in size (small, regular, large).

5. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - The shapes seem to alternate between different types and sizes.
   - There is no clear rotation or mirroring pattern.
   - The color shades do not seem to follow a pattern.

6. **Eliminate Options:**
   - By examining the options A to H, we can see that some options do not match the observed patterns in the grid.
   - For example, options that have shapes not present in the grid (like squares) can be eliminated.
   - Options that do not follow the alternating pattern of shapes and sizes can also be eliminated.

7. **Select the Correct Shape:**
   - After careful observation and elimination, the correct answer should match the pattern observed in the grid.
