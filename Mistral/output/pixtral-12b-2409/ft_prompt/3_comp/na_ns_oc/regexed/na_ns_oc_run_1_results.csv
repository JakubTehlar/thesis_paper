5. **Identify Patterns:**
   - There is no consistent transformation in shape type (e.g., all shapes are not rotating or flipping in a uniform manner).
   - The pattern seems to be more about the alternation of filled and outlined shapes.

6. **Determine the Rule:**
   - The bottom-right box marked with 'x' should follow the pattern of the third row and third column, which are both outlined shapes.
   - The third row and third column both have outlined shapes, so the bottom-right box should have an outlined shape.

7. **Eliminate Options:**
   - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are reviewed.
   - Options that do not fit the outlined shape pattern are eliminated.
