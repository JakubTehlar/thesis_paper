### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes are a hexagon, a hexagon, and a circle.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes are a pentagon, a square, and a pentagon.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes are a triangle, a hexagon, and a cross.

2. **Observe the Changes Across Columns:**
   - **First Column:** The shapes are a hexagon, a pentagon, and a triangle.
   - **Second Column:** The shapes are a hexagon, a square, and a hexagon.
   - **Third Column:** The shapes are a circle, a pentagon, and a cross.

3. **Observe the Changes Across Diagonals:**
   - **First Diagonal:** The shapes are a hexagon, a square, and a cross.
   - **Second Diagonal:** The shapes are a circle, a pentagon, and a triangle.

4. **Identify Patterns:**
   - **Shape Types:** The shapes include hexagons, pentagons, squares, circles, triangles, and crosses.
   - **Color Shades:** The shapes vary in color shades from light to dark.

5. **Eliminate Options:**

   - **Option E:** A dark hexagon.
   - **Option F:** A light circle.
   - **Option G:** A light square.
   - **Option H:** A light circle.

   Based on the patterns observed, the shapes in the grid do not follow a strict color or shape pattern. Instead, they seem to vary randomly.

### Conclusion:
Given the randomness in the shapes and colors, the correct answer should be a shape that fits the overall pattern without following a strict rule. The light circle (Option F) is a shape that appears in the grid and does not disrupt the randomness.

The correct answer is: **F**."

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes are a mix of circles, triangles, and hexagons. There is no clear transformation pattern in this row.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes are again a mix of circles, triangles, and hexagons. No clear pattern is evident.

4. **Identify Unique Features:**
   - The shapes include circles, triangles, and hexagons.
   - There is no consistent transformation pattern in terms of shape changes, rotations, or color shifts.

   - Since there is no clear pattern, we need to look for a shape that fits well with the existing shapes in the grid.
   - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H include various shapes and sizes. We need to find a shape that does not disrupt the existing pattern.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of a clear transformation pattern, the best approach is to select a shape that does not disrupt the existing pattern of mixed shapes. The most neutral choice would be a shape that is already present in the grid.

The correct answer is: **A**

(The reasoning here is that option A is a circle, which is already present in the grid and does not disrupt the existing pattern.)"
