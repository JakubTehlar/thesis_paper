1. **Observe the Changes Across Each Row, Column, and Diagonals:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes change from a hexagon to a pentagon to a circle.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes change from a pentagon to a square to a hexagon.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes change from a pentagon to a triangle to a cross.

   - **Second Column:** The shapes change from a pentagon to a square to a circle.
   - **Third Column:** The shapes change from a pentagon to a hexagon to a cross.
   - **Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):** The shapes change from a hexagon to a pentagon to a cross.
   - **Diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):** The shapes change from a hexagon to a pentagon to a triangle.

2. **Look for Common Pattern Types:**
   - **Shape Changes:** The shapes seem to transition from more complex to simpler forms (hexagon to pentagon to simpler shapes like circles, squares, triangles, and crosses).
   - **Color Shades:** The color shades seem to darken as we move from left to right and top to bottom.

3. **Identify Unique Features in the Shapes:**
   - The shapes start with more complex polygons and end with simpler geometric figures.
   - The color gradient becomes darker as we move from the top-left to the bottom-right.

4. **Eliminate Options (A to H) That Clearly Do Not Match the Observed Patterns:**
   - **Option A:** The shape is a square, which does not fit the pattern of transitioning from polygons to simpler shapes.
   - **Option B:** The shape is a pentagon, which fits the pattern but does not match the color gradient.
   - **Option C:** The shape is a circle, which fits the pattern but does not match the color gradient.
   - **Option D:** The shape is a pentagon, which fits the pattern but does not match the color gradient.
   - **Option E:** The shape is a pentagon, which fits the pattern but does not match the color gradient.
   - **Option F:** The shape is a circle, which fits the pattern but does not match the color gradient.
   - **Option G:** The shape is a circle, which fits the pattern but does not match the color gradient.
   - **Option H:** The shape is a circle with a dark shade, which fits both the shape and color gradient pattern.

5. **Select the Correct Shape That Completes the Pattern:**
   - The correct answer is **Option H**, which is a circle with a dark shade, fitting both the shape and color gradient pattern.

**Conclusion:**
The correct answer is: **H**."

   - **Second Diagonal:** The shapes are triangles of varying sizes and shades.
   - **Third Diagonal:** The shapes are a mix of circles and triangles, with varying sizes and shades.

4. **Identify Patterns:**
   - **Shape Transformation:** There is no consistent transformation in shape across rows, columns, or diagonals.
   - **Size Variation:** The size of the shapes varies, but this does not follow a consistent pattern.
   - **Shade Variation:** The shade of the shapes varies, but this does not follow a consistent pattern.

5. **Eliminate Options:**
   - **Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H:** These options include different shapes and sizes. Since there is no consistent transformation or pattern in shape, size, or shade, we need to look for another pattern.

6. **Unique Features:**
   - The shapes in the first column are all circles.
   - The shapes in the second column are all triangles.
   - The shapes in the third column are a mix of circles and triangles.

### Conclusion:
Given the unique feature that the first column contains only circles and the second column contains only triangles, the pattern suggests that the third column should also follow this rule. Since the third column already has a mix of shapes, the correct answer should be a shape that completes the pattern in a logical manner.

The correct answer is: **H**."

   - The pattern seems to involve alternating shapes between rows and columns.
   - The shapes in the first and third rows are more varied, while the second row is more consistent.

6. **Eliminate Options:**
   - Options that do not include circles or triangles can be eliminated.
   - Options that do not follow the alternating pattern can be eliminated.

### Conclusion:

Based on the observations and elimination process, the correct answer should follow the pattern of alternating shapes and include circles and triangles.
