### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes change from a hexagon to a pentagon to a circle.
   - **Second Row:** The shapes change from a pentagon to a square to a pentagon.
   - **Third Row:** The shapes change from a hexagon to a triangle to a cross.

2. **Observe the Changes Across Columns:**
   - **First Column:** The shapes change from a hexagon to a pentagon to a hexagon.
   - **Second Column:** The shapes change from a pentagon to a square to a pentagon.
   - **Third Column:** The shapes change from a circle to a pentagon to a cross.

3. **Observe the Diagonals:**
   - **First Diagonal (Top Left to Bottom Right):** The shapes change from a hexagon to a square to a cross.
   - **Second Diagonal (Top Right to Bottom Left):** The shapes change from a circle to a pentagon to a hexagon.

4. **Identify Common Patterns:**
   - **Shape Changes:** There is a mix of different shapes, including hexagons, pentagons, circles, squares, triangles, and crosses.
   - **Color Shades:** The shapes vary in color shades from light to dark.
   - **Size:** The sizes of the shapes vary.

5. **Eliminate Options:**

   Based on the observed patterns, we need to find a shape that fits the sequence. The shapes in the first row change from a hexagon to a pentagon to a circle. The second row changes from a pentagon to a square to a pentagon. The third row changes from a hexagon to a triangle to a cross. The diagonals also show a mix of shapes.

6. **Select the Correct Shape:**
   - The bottom-right box marked with an 'x' should have a shape that continues the pattern observed. Given the mix of shapes and the lack of a clear sequential pattern, the most logical choice is a shape that has been seen before and fits the overall diversity of shapes in the grid.

   The correct answer is a circle, which has been seen in the first column and first diagonal.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Observe the Changes Across Rows:**
   - **First Row:** The shapes are varied, including circles, triangles, and hexagons.

5. **Eliminate Options that Do Not Match the Observed Patterns:**
   - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H need to be examined to see if they fit the observed patterns.
   - Since there is no clear transformation, we need to look for a pattern that fits the filled shapes.

6. **Select the Correct Shape:**
   - The filled shapes are in the second and third rows. This suggests a pattern where the shapes are filled as they move from the first row to the second and third rows.
   - Option H has a filled hexagon, which fits the pattern of filled shapes.

   - The third row shows two pentagons with a small circle inside and a cross symbol.

3. **Identify Unique Features in the Shapes:**
   - The shapes are varied in terms of their outer form (circle, hexagon, pentagon, square, triangle).
   - The central feature is a small circle in the first two rows and a cross in the third row.

4. **Eliminate Options (A to H) That Clearly Do Not Match the Observed Patterns:**
   - Options A, B, E, and F do not contain a small circle in the center, so they can be eliminated.
