Now, let's look at the options provided (A to F):

- **A:** Square
- **B:** Small Circle
- **C:** Small Circle
- **D:** Small Circle
- **E:** Triangle
- **F:** Hexagon

Given the patterns in the grid, we need to find a shape that fits consistently across the rows and columns. The empty box is in the third column of the third row. Let's analyze the third column:

- **First Row:** Square
- **Second Row:** Triangle
- **Third Row:** Cross

The third column has a mix of shapes, making it difficult to determine a specific pattern. However, the fourth and fifth rows show a pattern of repeating shapes (Small Circle and Triangle, respectively).

Considering the options and the patterns, the shape that fits best in the empty box is the Triangle (option E), as it appears consistently in the fourth and fifth rows.
