1. **Examine the Grid**: The grid consists of nine boxes with different shapes. One box is empty, marked with a question mark (?).

2. **Identify the Pattern**: The shapes in the grid are arranged in a specific sequence. We need to determine the rule governing the transition from one shape to the next.

3. **Analyze the Shapes**: The shapes in the grid include circles, hexagons, squares, and pentagons. The shapes are arranged in a sequence that appears to follow a specific transformation rule.

4. **Determine the Rule**: By examining the sequence, we can see that the shapes are transitioning from one form to another in a consistent manner. For example, a circle might be transforming into a hexagon, then into a square, and so on.

5. **Match the Shapes with Options**: Compare the shapes in the grid with the options provided (A to F). Look for the shape that fits the pattern and completes the sequence.

6. **Identify the Correct Shape**: After analyzing the pattern and comparing the shapes, we find that the shape that fits the sequence and completes the pattern is option E.

   - Shape 3: Square with a small square inside.

2. **Middle Row**: 
   - Shape 1: Square with a small square inside.
   - Shape 2: Pentagon with a small square inside.

3. **Bottom Row**: 
   - Shape 1: Pentagon with a small square inside.
   - Shape 2: Pentagon with a small square inside.
   - Shape 3: Pentagon with a small square inside.

From the analysis, we can see that the pattern involves shapes with a small square inside. The shapes alternate between pentagons, triangles, and squares. The empty box is in the bottom row, third column.

To fill the empty box, we need to determine which shape from the options (A to F) fits the pattern. Let's examine each option:

- **B**: Pentagon with a small square inside.
- **C**: Pentagon with a small square inside.
- **D**: Pentagon with a small square inside.
- **E**: Pentagon with a small square inside.
- **F**: Pentagon with a small square inside.

All the options (A to F) are pentagons with a small square inside, which fits the pattern observed in the bottom row. Therefore, any of these options could be correct.

Given the repetition of the same shape in the bottom row, the correct answer is any of the pentagons with a small square inside.

2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a square, a diamond, a triangle, a hexagon, and a pentagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a triangle, a square, a pentagon, a hexagon, and a square.

To determine the pattern, let's look at the transformations from one shape to another:

- **Triangle to Square**: The triangle can be transformed into a square by rotating it 90 degrees.
- **Square to Pentagon**: The square can be transformed into a pentagon by adding one side.
- **Pentagon to Hexagon**: The pentagon can be transformed into a hexagon by adding one more side.
- **Hexagon to Square**: The hexagon can be transformed into a square by removing one side.

Following this pattern, the sequence of transformations is:
- Triangle → Square → Pentagon → Hexagon → Square

Given this sequence, the empty box should be filled with a shape that follows the pattern. The correct sequence for the empty box is from a square to a pentagon.

- **C:** Small Square
- **D:** Black Hexagon
- **E:** Small Hexagon
- **F:** Black Hexagon

The second column alternates between a Circle and a Square. Looking at the options, the only shapes that can alternate with the Circle are the Square (C) and the Black Square (B).
