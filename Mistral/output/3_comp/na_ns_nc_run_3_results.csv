- B: Triangle with empty triangle
- C: Triangle with small triangle
- D: Triangle with filled hexagon
- E: Triangle with small triangle
- F: Triangle with empty hexagon

Now, let's identify the pattern. The shapes in the grid seem to follow a pattern where each shape in the top row corresponds to a similar shape in the bottom row but with a different fill or orientation. For example:

- The circle with a square in the top left corresponds to the circle with a diamond in the bottom left.
- The pentagon with a circle in the top middle corresponds to the pentagon with a filled diamond in the bottom middle.
- The triangle with a hexagon in the top right corresponds to the cross in the bottom right.

Following this pattern, the empty box in the grid should have a shape that is similar to the shape in the top row but with a different fill or orientation. The top row has a triangle with a hexagon. The corresponding shape in the bottom row is the cross. The correct shape should be a triangle with a different fill or orientation.
