     - Circle to Irregular Polygon
   - From the middle row to the bottom row:
     - Circle to Irregular Polygon
     - Hexagon to Circle
     - Irregular Polygon to Triangle

3. **Determine the pattern**:
   - The pattern seems to involve a transformation from one shape to another in a specific sequence.
   - Observing the transformations, it appears that the shapes are changing in a way that involves rotating or flipping them.

4. **Identify the correct shape for the empty box**:
   - The empty box is in the bottom row, third column.
   - The shape in the middle row, third column, is an Irregular Polygon.
   - The shape in the top row, third column, is a Circle.
   - The shape in the middle row, third column, is an Irregular Polygon.

12. **Ninth Column**:
    - Shapes: Hexagon, Pentagon, Circle
    - Pattern: Alternating shapes between hexagons and pentagons, and circles.

Given the patterns, we need to determine which shape fits in the empty box in the third row, fifth column. The third row, fifth column currently has a Pentagon. The pattern in the fifth column alternates between Hexagons and Pentagons, and Circles. Since the previous shape is a Pentagon, the next shape should be a Hexagon.

Therefore, the correct answer is a Hexagon.

The correct answer is: **D**."
2,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_os_oc_left_center_single_right_center_single_RAVEN_9755_train.png,C,D,False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. **Top Row**: 
   - Box 1: Triangle
   - Box 2: Diamond
   - Box 3: Circle

2. **Middle Row**: 
   - Box 1: Hexagon
   - Box 2: Triangle

Now, let's examine the options (A to F) and see which one fits the pattern:

- **Option A**: Diamond
- **Option B**: Square
- **Option C**: Triangle
- **Option D**: Square
- **Option E**: Triangle
- **Option F**: Square

The pattern seems to alternate between different shapes. Specifically, the shapes in the top row are Triangle, Diamond, and Circle. The middle row has Hexagon, Triangle, and Pentagon. The bottom row has Diamond, Triangle, and Square.

Given this pattern, the empty box in the bottom row should follow the sequence of the previous shapes. The previous shape in the bottom row is a Triangle, so the next shape should be a Square.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

3,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_os_oc_distribute_nine_RAVEN_9911_train.png,G,B,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in each box:

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and an inverted triangle.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a hexagon, a circle, and a pentagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a pentagon, a circle, and a hexagon.

Next, we need to look at the shapes in the columns:

1. **First Column**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a circle.
2. **Second Column**: The shapes are a hexagon, a circle, and a pentagon.
3. **Third Column**: The shapes are a pentagon, a circle, and a hexagon.

Finally, let's examine the shapes in the diagonals:

1. **Main Diagonal (Top Left to Bottom Right)**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a hexagon.
2. **Secondary Diagonal (Top Right to Bottom Left)**: The shapes are a pentagon, a circle, and a pentagon.

From this analysis, we can see that the pattern alternates between circles and hexagons in the main diagonal. Therefore, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a hexagon.

1. Top row: Triangle, Circle, Diamond
2. Middle row: Square, Inverted Triangle, Circle
3. Bottom row: Circle, Square, Circle

Now, let's look at the options provided:

- A: Hexagon
- B: Small Hexagon
- C: Large Hexagon
- D: Small Triangle
- E: Hollow Triangle
- F: Large Triangle

To determine the pattern, we need to consider the shapes' properties, such as their number of sides, orientation, and color. The shapes in the grid include triangles, circles, squares, and diamonds. The shapes are either filled or hollow and have different orientations.

Upon closer inspection, we notice that the shapes alternate between filled and hollow. The filled shapes are: Triangle, Circle, Diamond, Square, Inverted Triangle, and Circle. The hollow shapes are: Circle, Square, and Circle.

Given this pattern, the missing shape should be a hollow shape. Among the options, the hollow shapes are:

- E: Hollow Triangle
- F: Large Triangle

Since the grid already contains a hollow triangle (E), the next hollow shape should be a Circle. Therefore, the correct answer is a hollow Circle.

The correct answer is: B

3. Top-right: Pentagon with a circle inside.
4. Middle-left: Pentagon with a circle inside.
5. Middle-middle: Circle with a small square inside.
6. Middle-right: Square inside a diamond.
7. Bottom-left: Diamond with a small square inside.

9. Bottom-right: Cross mark.

The empty box is in the bottom-right corner, marked with a question mark (?).

Now, let's examine the options (A to F):

- A: Pentagon with a circle inside.
- B: Circle with a small square inside.
- C: Pentagon with a circle inside.
- D: Circle with a small square inside.
- E: Pentagon with a circle inside.
- F: Pentagon with a circle inside.

From the grid, we observe that the shapes alternate between pentagons with circles inside and circles with small squares inside. The shapes in the grid follow this pattern:

- Top-left: Circle with a pentagon inside.
- Top-middle: Diamond with a square inside.
- Top-right: Pentagon with a circle inside.
- Middle-left: Pentagon with a circle inside.
- Middle-middle: Circle with a small square inside.
- Middle-right: Square inside a diamond.
- Bottom-left: Diamond with a small square inside.
- Bottom-middle: Pentagon with a circle inside.
- Bottom-right: Cross mark (?).

The pattern alternates between pentagons with circles and circles with small squares. The bottom-right corner, which is empty, should follow this pattern. The previous shape in the bottom row is a pentagon with a circle inside, so the next shape should be a circle with a small square inside.
