1. Top row: pentagon, irregular pentagon, circle
2. Middle row: circle, hexagon, pentagon
3. Bottom row: pentagon, circle, irregular pentagon

Next, we examine the options provided:

- A: Large triangle
- B: Small hexagon
- C: Small pentagon
- D: Large hexagon
- E: Large triangle
- F: Large hexagon

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the shape transformations or relationships between the shapes. One possible pattern could be the transformation of shapes from one form to another, such as a pentagon to a circle or a hexagon to a triangle.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the shapes in the grid are transitioning from larger to smaller forms and from pentagons to circles and hexagons. The pattern seems to involve a transition from larger shapes to smaller shapes and from pentagons to circles and hexagons.

Given this pattern, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a smaller shape that fits the transition pattern. Among the options, the small pentagon (C) fits this pattern as it transitions from the pentagon in the adjacent box.

The correct answer is: C"

### Conclusion:
The pattern involves alternating between polygons and circles. In the middle column, the shapes alternate between hexagons, circles, and pentagons. The empty box in the middle column needs a shape that fits this pattern.

Given the pattern, the empty box should be filled with a hexagon.

Given the complexity and variety of shapes, it seems the pattern might be based on the type of shape rather than size or color. The empty box is in the third row, third column. We need to find a shape that fits this pattern.

Upon closer inspection, the third row, third column is currently empty. The shapes in the third row include a Large Circle, Hexagon, Pentagon, Triangle, Small Diamond, and Cross. The empty box is the only one without a shape.

Considering the variety and lack of a clear pattern based on size or color, the most logical choice is to fill the empty box with a shape that completes the pattern in the third row. The shape that fits best is a Triangle, as it appears multiple times in the grid.
