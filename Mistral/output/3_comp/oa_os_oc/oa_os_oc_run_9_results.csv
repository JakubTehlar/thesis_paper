1. Top row: A pentagon, a dark pentagon, a circle.
2. Middle row: A circle, a pentagon, a dark pentagon.
3. Bottom row: A pentagon, a circle, an 'X'.

Now, let's look at the options provided:

- A: Dark triangle
- B: Light hexagon
- C: Dark hexagon
- D: Dark pentagon
- E: Dark triangle
- F: Light pentagon

To determine the pattern, we need to consider the shape transformations and color changes. The shapes in the grid are pentagons, circles, and an 'X'. The options include triangles and hexagons, which are not present in the grid. This suggests that the pattern might involve a transformation from pentagons to hexagons or triangles.

Given the sequence of shapes, the pattern seems to involve alternating between light and dark shapes. The empty box in the grid is in the bottom row, third column. The shapes to its left and above are a pentagon and a circle, respectively. The pattern alternates between pentagons and circles, and light and dark colors.

Considering these observations, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a light pentagon, which matches the pattern of alternating light and dark shapes.

1. **Shape Types**: The shapes include circles, triangles, diamonds, hexagons, and squares.
2. **Color Shading**: The shapes are shaded in different ways, including solid, half-shaded, and empty.
3. **Positioning**: The shapes are positioned in a specific pattern within the grid.

To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the rule governing the arrangement of the shapes. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the Empty Box**: The empty box is in the middle of the grid.
2. **Analyze the Surrounding Shapes**: Look at the shapes adjacent to the empty box and identify any patterns.
3. **Determine the Rule**: The rule could be based on shape type, shading, or position.

Let's analyze the shapes around the empty box:

- Top-left: Hexagon (half-shaded)
- Top-right: Triangle (solid)
- Bottom-left: Circle (half-shaded)
- Bottom-right: Diamond (solid)

The pattern seems to involve alternating shapes and shading. The empty box is surrounded by shapes with different shading and types. The correct shape should follow this pattern.

Given the options (A to F), we need to find a shape that fits the pattern:

- **A**: Diamond (solid)
- **B**: Square (half-shaded)
- **C**: Triangle (half-shaded)
- **D**: Circle (solid)
- **E**: Hexagon (solid)
- **F**: Diamond (half-shaded)

Comparing these options with the surrounding shapes, the correct shape should be a solid diamond (A), which matches the solid diamond on the bottom-right.

1. **Top Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and an inverted triangle.
2. **Middle Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a pentagon.
3. **Bottom Row**: The shapes are a circle, a hexagon, and a pentagon.

Now, let's look at the options provided (A to F):

- **A**: Circles of different sizes
- **B**: Hexagons of different sizes
- **C**: A combination of a pentagon and a hexagon
- **D**: A combination of a circle and a hexagon
- **E**: A combination of a circle and a pentagon
- **F**: A combination of a hexagon and a pentagon

The pattern in the grid alternates between a circle, a hexagon, and another shape. Observing the sequence, it seems that the pattern alternates between a circle and a hexagon, followed by a different shape. Therefore, the correct shape to fill the empty box should follow this pattern.

Given the sequence in the top row (circle, hexagon, inverted triangle) and the middle row (circle, hexagon, pentagon), the pattern suggests that the next shape should be a hexagon. Therefore, the correct answer is a hexagon.

The correct answer is: B

Next, let's examine the options provided:

- A: Hexagon
- B: Small Hexagon
- C: Large Hexagon
- D: Small Triangle
- E: Hollow Triangle
- F: Large Hollow Triangle

To determine the pattern, we need to look at the attributes of the shapes in the grid. The shapes vary in their geometric properties, such as the number of sides and whether they are filled or hollow. However, a consistent pattern might be based on the alternation of shapes or the presence of specific shapes.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the pattern involves alternating between filled and hollow shapes. Let's verify this:

- Top row: Triangle (filled), Circle (filled), Diamond (hollow)
- Middle row: Square (filled), Inverted Triangle (filled), Circle (filled)
- Bottom row: Circle (filled), Square (filled), Circle (filled)

The empty box in the grid is in the bottom row, third column. The shapes in the bottom row are Circle, Square, Circle. The pattern of filled and hollow shapes alternates, and the empty box should be filled with a Circle to maintain the pattern.

Therefore, the correct answer is a filled Circle, which corresponds to option B.

Given these patterns, we need to determine which shape fits in the empty box in the third column of the second row.

- The third column of the second row is currently filled with circles.
- The second row has a pattern of circles.

Therefore, the correct shape to fill the empty box should be a circle.

From the observations, we can see that the pattern alternates between having different shapes in each column and having the same shape in each column. The pattern in the rows follows a sequence of different shapes and then the same shape.

Given this pattern, the empty box in the fourth row should follow the sequence of different shapes. The shapes in the fourth row are Triangle, Triangle, and Cross. The pattern suggests that the next shape should be different from the previous two.

Let's examine the options:

From the above analysis, we can see that the pattern alternates between filled and unfilled shapes. The empty box in the grid is the fourth box in the third row. To maintain the pattern, we need to place a shape that alternates with the previous filled shape.

The previous filled shape in the third row is a Triangle. Therefore, the next shape should be an unfilled shape. Among the options A to F, the unfilled shapes are:
