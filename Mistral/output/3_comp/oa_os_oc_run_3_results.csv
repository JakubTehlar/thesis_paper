0,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/oa_os_oc_center_single_RAVEN_9918_test.png,D,C,False,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: pentagon, irregular pentagon, circle
2. Middle row: circle, hexagon, irregular pentagon
3. Bottom row: pentagon, circle, cross

Next, let's examine the options provided:

- A: Large triangle
- B: Small hexagon
- C: Small pentagon
- D: Large hexagon
- E: Large triangle
- F: Large hexagon

Now, let's identify the pattern. The shapes in the grid include pentagons, circles, and irregular shapes. The pattern seems to involve the transformation of shapes from one form to another. Specifically, the shapes transition from pentagons to circles to crosses, and then back to pentagons.

Given this pattern, the correct shape to fill the empty box should follow the sequence of transformations. The sequence in the grid is:
- Top row: pentagon → irregular pentagon → circle
- Middle row: circle → hexagon → irregular pentagon
- Bottom row: pentagon → circle → cross

Following this pattern, the next shape should be a pentagon. Among the options, the shape that fits this pattern is a pentagon.
