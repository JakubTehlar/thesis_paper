### Row 1:
- Shape 1: Dark circle
- Shape 2: Dark pentagon
- Shape 3: Dark triangle

### Row 2:
- Shape 1: Light circle
- Shape 2: Light pentagon
- Shape 3: Light triangle

### Row 3:
- Shape 1: Light square
- Shape 2: Light pentagon
- Shape 3: Light triangle

### Empty Box:
- The empty box is in the third row, second column.

### Options:
- A: Light circle
- B: Light circle
- C: Light square
- D: Light diamond
- E: Light circle
- F: Light diamond

### Analysis:
1. **Shape Transformation**:
   - The shapes in the first column change from dark to light.
   - The shapes in the second column change from dark to light pentagon to light square.
   - The shapes in the third column change from dark to light triangle.

2. **Column Pattern**:
   - Column 1: Circle (Dark) -> Circle (Light) -> Circle (Light)
   - Column 2: Pentagon (Dark) -> Pentagon (Light) -> Square (Light)
   - Column 3: Triangle (Dark) -> Triangle (Light) -> Triangle (Light)

Given the pattern, the empty box in the third row, second column should follow the pattern of the second column. The second column transitions from a light pentagon to a light square. Therefore, the shape in the empty box should be a light square.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is: C"

The shapes in the grid are arranged in a specific sequence, and we need to identify the rule governing this sequence. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - Top row: Circle, Circle, Circle
   - Middle row: Circle, Circle, Circle
   - Bottom row: Circle, Circle, Circle

2. **Identify the pattern:**
   - All the shapes in the grid are circles.

3. **Determine the rule:**
   - The rule is that all shapes in the grid are circles.

4. **Apply the rule to the empty box:**
   - Since the rule is that all shapes are circles, the shape that should fill the empty box must also be a circle.

5. **Check the options:**
   - A: Two Circles
   - B: Circle
   - C: Circle
   - D: Circle
   - E: Circle, Circle, Circle
   - F: Circle, Circle, Circle

6. **Select the correct option:**
   - The correct answer is any option that contains a circle. The simplest and most straightforward choice is option B, which is a single circle.

1. Top row: Pentagon with a circle, pentagon with a pentagon, pentagon with a triangle.
2. Middle row: Circle with a circle, circle with a pentagon, circle with a triangle.
3. Bottom row: Triangle with a circle, triangle with a pentagon, cross mark.

The pattern seems to involve the shapes inside the larger shapes. Let's look at the options (A to F) and see which one fits the pattern:

- A: Triangle with a triangle.
- B: Triangle with a pentagon.
- C: Triangle with a circle.
- D: Pentagon with a triangle.
- E: Pentagon with a pentagon.
- F: Pentagon with a circle.

The pattern in the grid involves the following shapes inside the larger shapes:
- Top row: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle.
- Middle row: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle.
- Bottom row: Circle, Pentagon, Cross mark.

Since the cross mark breaks the pattern, we can ignore it. The pattern alternates between Circle, Pentagon, and Triangle. The empty box in the bottom row should follow the pattern of Triangle.

Therefore, the correct answer is a Triangle with a Circle inside it.

",False,"To solve this intelligence test question, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: Hexagon with triangle, Square with triangle, Circle with triangle
2. Middle row: Circle with square, Hexagon with square, Square with square
3. Bottom row: Diamond with circle, Hexagon with circle, Circle with circle

First, let's look at the shapes in the top row:
- Hexagon with triangle
- Square with triangle
- Circle with triangle

The pattern here seems to be that the shape changes from a hexagon to a square to a circle, while the triangle remains constant.

Next, let's look at the shapes in the middle row:
- Circle with square
- Hexagon with square
- Square with square

The pattern here seems to be that the shape changes from a circle to a hexagon to a square, while the square remains constant.

Finally, let's look at the shapes in the bottom row:
- Diamond with circle
- Hexagon with circle
- Circle with circle

The pattern here seems to be that the shape changes from a diamond to a hexagon to a circle, while the circle remains constant.

Combining these observations, we can see that the pattern involves alternating between different shapes while keeping one shape constant. The constant shape in the bottom row is the circle. Therefore, the pattern in the bottom row should continue with a hexagon with a circle.
