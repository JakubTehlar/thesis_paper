1. **First Row**:
   - Shapes: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle
   - Observation: The shapes are different in each box.

2. **Second Row**:
   - Shapes: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon
   - Observation: The shapes are the same in each box.

1,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_os_oc_distribute_four_RAVEN_9770_train.png,F,F,True,"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern in the 3x3 grid. Let's break down the shapes and their arrangement:

1. **Identify the shapes in the grid:**
   - The grid contains circles, triangles, and pentagons.
   - The shapes are arranged in a specific pattern.

2. **Analyze the pattern:**
   - The top row has three shapes: a triangle, a pentagon, and a circle.
   - The middle row has three shapes: a pentagon, a circle, and a triangle.
   - The bottom row has three shapes: a circle, a pentagon, and a circle.

3. **Determine the repeating pattern:**
   - The pattern alternates between shapes: triangle, pentagon, circle.
   - This pattern repeats every three shapes.

4. **Identify the empty box:**
   - The empty box is in the bottom row, third position.

5. **Determine the correct shape for the empty box:**
   - Following the pattern (triangle, pentagon, circle), the third position in the bottom row should be a triangle.

6. **Match the pattern with the options:**
   - Option A: Two circles, one triangle
   - Option B: One circle
   - Option C: One circle
   - Option D: One circle
   - Option E: Three circles
   - Option F: Two circles, one triangle

Based on the pattern analysis, the correct answer is Option F.

2,Datasets/3_comp/output_data/na_os_oc_in_center_single_out_center_single_RAVEN_9991_train.png,C,C,True,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the shapes in the grid:

1. Top row: Pentagon with a circle, pentagon with a pentagon, pentagon with a triangle.
2. Middle row: Circle with a circle, circle with a pentagon, circle with a triangle.
3. Bottom row: Triangle with a circle, triangle with a pentagon, and an empty box with a question mark (?).

We need to determine the pattern that relates the shapes in the grid. One possible approach is to look at the shapes inside the containers (pentagons, circles, triangles) and see if there is a sequence or transformation.

Let's examine the shapes in the filled boxes:
- Top row: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle.
- Middle row: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle.
- Bottom row: Circle, Pentagon.

The pattern seems to involve the shapes inside the containers changing from one type to another. Specifically, the shapes inside the containers follow a sequence: Circle, Pentagon, Triangle.

Given this pattern, the empty box should contain a shape that follows the sequence. The sequence is Circle, Pentagon, Triangle, Circle, Pentagon, Triangle, Circle, Pentagon, Triangle.

Since the bottom row follows the sequence and the last filled box in the bottom row has a Pentagon, the next shape in the sequence should be a Triangle.

Therefore, the correct answer is the shape that fits the pattern and completes the sequence.

The correct answer is: C"

1. Top row: Hexagon with triangle, Square with triangle, Circle with triangle
2. Middle row: Circle with square, Hexagon with square, Square with square
3. Bottom row: Diamond with circle, Hexagon with circle, Circle with circle

Now, let's look at the options provided (A to F):

- A: Hexagon with dark circle
- B: Hexagon with light circle
- C: Hexagon with light circle
- D: Hexagon with dark circle
- E: Hexagon with light circle
- F: Hexagon with dark circle

We need to determine the pattern that applies to the shapes in the grid. The shapes in the grid are varied in terms of their shapes (hexagon, square, circle, diamond) and the objects inside them (triangle, square, circle).

Upon closer inspection, we notice that the shapes in the grid alternate between having a dark circle and a light circle. Specifically:
- Top row: Circle with triangle (light circle), Square with triangle (light circle), Circle with triangle (light circle)
- Middle row: Circle with square (light circle), Hexagon with square (light circle), Square with square (light circle)
- Bottom row: Diamond with circle (dark circle), Hexagon with circle (dark circle), Circle with circle (light circle)

The pattern alternates between dark and light circles. Since the empty box is in the bottom row, which follows the dark circle pattern, we need a shape with a dark circle.

The correct answer is: D"

4. **Empty Box Analysis**:
   - The empty box is located in the third column.
   - The shape in the third column of the top row is a triangle.
   - The shape in the third column of the middle row is a triangle.
